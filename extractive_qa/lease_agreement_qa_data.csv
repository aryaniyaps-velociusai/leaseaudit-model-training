Deposit Waiver Purchase Agreement
This document is an agreement (this ""Agreement"") between SPRINGHILL APARTMENTS Apartments (the ""Property"") and Zoey Medina (the ""Resident""). Pursuant to this Agreement, Resident is electing to purchase a Deposit Waiver (a ""Waiver"") as indicated herein with respect to the Lease Agreement, dated March 06, 2023 between SPRINGHILL APARTMENTS (the ""Property"") and Zoey Medina (the ""Resident"") for the premises located at 8030 E Lakeside Parkway, Tucson, AZ 85730.
1. Resident agrees to purchase the Waiver and to pay the monthly Waiver Fees directly to the Property for the duration of time Resident occupies the unit, as an alternative to any applicable Lease Agreement requirements to place with the Property certain security deposits, pet security deposits, and/or sourcing a co-signer or guarantor as conditions to lease approval and execution. Should Resident not purchase the Waiver, Resident shall, instead, seek to place security deposit(s) with the Property in accordance with any applicable security deposits policy of the Property. Should any conflict exist between the provisions of the Lease Agreement and this Addendum, the provisions of this executed Addendum shall control.
2. Resident's purchase of the Waiver shall not otherwise modify, waive, or alter any other terms or conditions of the Lease Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the parties.
3. Pursuant to and limited only by the relevant laws of the state, municipality, or controlling jurisdiction under which the Property is located, Resident agrees to all Waiver Fees set forth hereunder. Resident shall remit the Waiver Fees as indicated below:
Resident shall remit the Security Deposit Waiver Fee on a monthly basis, for the duration of time the Resident occupies the unit, as itemized in the Resident's lease billing statement, in the amount of $ 36.00.
4. Resident certifies the understanding of, and agreement to, the following terms of Waiver(s) purchase (Initial Each):
ZM
INITIAL
I agree to remit on-time Waiver Fee payments to the Property in order to maintain a current account (i.e., not delinquent). I understand that a failure to remit any Waiver Fee when due will be deemed a material violation of the Lease Agreement which may result in adverse action, including the possibility of eviction.
INITIAL
I understand that any Waiver Fee is NOT a Security Deposit, and that any Waiver Fee that I pay is NOT refundable.
INITIAL
I accept and understand that no ""deposit"" funds will be held by the Property on my behalf or to my benefit to pay for physical damage to the unit or premises or for unpaid rent, and that the Property may receive a benefit as a result of my Deposit Waiver purchase.
2
INITIAL
I understand that the Waiver Fee is NOT a Security Deposit nor is it a payment, current or in advance, for the expenses that the Property may incur which would normally be covered by funds held as a Security Deposit.

Lessor may assign parking spaces or areas for Lessees and guests. Lessor may also designate: (1) Parking areas; (2) Whether trailers, boats, or campers may park and whether inoperable, abandoned or unauthorized vehicles will be towed at the owner's expense after a 24-hour notice is posted on the vehicle. Vehicles parked in fire lanes, reserved parking or undesignated parking will be towed (with 24 hours notice) at owner's expense. The 24-hour notice does not apply to vehicles that are parked in a space assigned to another Lessee, parked in a marked tow-away or parked to impede traffic or trash collection easements. Vehicles parked in this manner will be towed away immediately without warning at owner's expense. If Lessor pays Lessee's towing expense, such expense shall be deemed as additional rent owed and be immediately due and payable. Guests must only park in designated spaces - never on sidewalks, in landscape areas or apartments and must not damage asphalt, etc. Vehicles parked on the property must park ""head in"" only and show current registration. Lessor may elect to charge as additional rent a $100.00 fee for repeat offenders. Please limit your speed within the community to 10 mph.
8. AUTOMOBILES: Notwithstanding the Parking/Vehicle Policies set forth above, the following additional restrictions shall apply: (1) One vehicle per licensed Leaseholder; (2) All vehicles must have a current state registration, be in operable condition, and registered in the Lessor office; (3) Inoperable cars (cars with flat tires, broken windows, etc.) will not be permitted on the premises; (4) Any vehicle(s) deemed abandoned in the sole judgment of the Owner or which are not registered will be towed at the vehicle owner's expense after a 24-hour notice has been placed on the vehicle; (5) Any vehicle(s) illegally parked in a fire lane, blocking an entrance, exit, driveway, dumpster, or parked illegally in a designated parking space will be immediately towed, without notice, at the owner's expense; (7) Lessees may NOT wash or repair a car in the parking lot or empty ashtrays/trash from their cars into the parking lot or on property; (8) If recreational vehicles are permitted on the property, they must be parked in the area designated by Lessor; (9) Handicapped-designated parking spaces are solely for the use of vehicles displaying the appropriate placards or license plates.
9. COVERED PARKING: Lessee acknowledges that carports are reserved for use only by the Lessee renting or assigned to such space. Lessee further understands that unauthorized cars parked in a reserved or an assigned covered parking space by a Lessee, occupant or guest will be subject to towing without notice at the vehicle owner's expense. Lessees should inform their guests of these provisions. If an unauthorized vehicle is parked in uncovered parking, please contact the Lessor Office so we may tag the car for 24-hours prior to having it towed at the vehicle owner's expense.
10. ACCESS: Except in case of emergency or if it is impracticable to give notice, Lessor will not enter Lessee's apartment without prior notice. Lessee further agrees that a notification to Lessor of a service or maintenance request grants Lessor authority to enter the apartment at all reasonable times for the purpose of that request, and Lessor must have advanced written permission from Lessee to open Lessee's apartment for others (i.e. delivery personnel, service personnel, friends, etc.). Lessee is aware that under these circumstances Lessor is not responsible for lost or stolen articles, damage or doors left unlocked.
11. FAIR HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS: This Community is dedicated to honoring Federal, State and City Fair Housing laws. Accommodations will be made/allowed as reasonably necessary to the rules, policies, practices and services of the community in order to enable Lessees with disabilities to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their dwelling. The Community reserves the right to require reasonable medical evidence of the disability and that the requested accommodation is necessary. Persons who need an accommodation because of a disability may contact Lessor to request an accommodation for a disability.
12. FAIR HOUSING MODIFICATIONS: Reasonable modifications refer to structural changes that are necessary to permit a person with a disability to use and enjoy a dwelling. Persons who need modifications to their dwelling units must contact management to secure permission for such modifications prior to making them. The Lessee may be required to restore the premises to their prior condition if failure to make restoration would interfere with the Owner's or next Lessee's use and enjoyment of the premises.
13. OPTION TO RENEW/RENT INCREASE: At expiration of the initial term of this lease, this lease will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis under the same terms and conditions unless Lessee gives Lessor a Vacate Notice at least sixty (60) days prior to expiration of the initial term of the lease, or unless Lessor, at its sole option, chooses not to renew this lease, and in such cases, Lessee agrees to vacate on the expiration date of the initial term. The rent may increase upon the expiration of the initial term if Lessor provides a sixty (60) day written notice to Lessee. A specific length lease of greater than one month may be required for continued occupancy.
14. INDEMNIFICATION: Lessor shall not be liable for any damage or injury to the Lessee(s) or any other person or to any property occurring on the premises, or any part thereof, or in the common areas thereof unless such damage or injury is the result of negligence or unlawful acts of Lessor, its agents or employees. Lessee understands that Lessor's insurance does not protect Lessees against any loss or damage including, but not limited to burglary, vandalism, fire, smoke, water damage or other perils to Lessee's personal property or belongings, or for any personal injury while on or off the premises. Each Lessee is advised to obtain a policy of Renter's Insurance protecting his/her household goods and personal property.
15. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY: If Lessor or Lessor's representative accepts packages to be delivered to a Lessee as a convenience to the Lessee, Lessor or Lessor's representative shall bear no liability for doing so. The same limitation is extended to include admitting repair service people not affiliated with the property into a Lessee's apartment at Lessee's written request.
16. SAFETY; LIABILITY; RELEASE; INSURANCE: Lessee acknowledges that personal and property security and safety of the Lessee and Lessee's occupants and guests is the responsibility of the Lessee and local law enforcement agencies and not the responsibility of management.
By initialing the appropriate box below, I acknowledge that I understand that the property or liability insurance coverage purchased by the community manager or owner is not intended to protect against loss or damage (i.e. burglary, vandalism, fire, smoke, or any other perils) to my personal belongings or to protect against loss or damage resulting from my or my family's actions. I also understand that I should not expect the community manager or owner to be responsible for such losses.
CHECK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING AND INITIAL BELOW:
[x] I WILL PURCHASE COVERAGE. I recognize my need for insurance and understand that by making this selection I am not purchasing coverage from the management company. I will independently purchase coverage on my own and provide policy information to the management company.
[ ] I HAVE COVERAGE. I have and will maintain throughout the term of my lease the following coverage: Insurance Company: Policy Number:
Property Limit: $0.00 Liability Limit: $0.00 [ ] I DO NOT HAVE COVERAGE. Although I recognize my need for insurance, I will not be obtaining such insurance coverage and understand that I am personally responsible for any property or liability damage to my own property, the community manager's, owner's or third party's property.
N 1 INITIAL
This section must be completed in full and initialed by the resident(s). Any insurance required or suggested in connection with this lease can be satisfied by a policy purchased through an authorized agent or insurance company in this state.
A. Lessee shall look solely to the public police force for security protection and Lessee agrees and acknowledges that protection against criminal action is not within the power of Lessor and Owner, and even if from time to time Lessor provides security services, those services cannot be relied upon by Lessee and shall not constitute a waiver of, or in any manner modify the above agreement. Lessor and Owner shall not be liable for failure to provide adequate security services or for criminal or wrongful actions by others against Lessee, Lessee's relatives or Lessee's guests. Lessee recognizes that Lessor does not guarantee or assure the personal safety or security of Lessee or Lessee's occupants or guests and that Lessor's efforts are done in an effort to reduce the risk of crime in the community. In this regard, the presence of any patrol service, gate(s), alarm system and/or other security device is no guaranty as to the personal safety or security of the Lessee or the Lessee's occupants or guests.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties to this Addendum agree to add the following terms and conditions to the residential lease contract that exists between these parties to set forth a clear understanding of the responsibilities of both Resident and Management under the Lease Agreement with the desire that by setting forth these mutual responsibilities as part of the Addendum, the parties can minimize the costs, inconveniences and misunderstandings that often result from pest infestation
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. This Addendum hereby supplements and modifies the Lease Agreement between the parties, and it shall be incorporated as a part of the Lease Agreement.

If the Lease begins after the first day of the month, Tenant must pay when it signs this Lease one (1) full months' Rent and for the next full calendar month Tenant shall pay a prorated Rent based on the number of days the Lease began after the first day of the month (for example, if the beginning date of this Lease is the 16 th day of the month, Tenant would pay for fifteen (15) out of thirty (30) days, or one-half (1/2), of a full months' Rent for the second calendar month). In any event, if the Lease Commencement Date shall not occur on the first day of a calendar month, the Term shall also include the remainder of the month in which the Lease Commencement Date occurred.
D.

Tenant's failure to so deliver the Memorandum Confirming Term shall be considered a material default under this Lease, however, Tenant's failure to do so shall not affect the occurrence of the Lease Commencement Date or the validity of this Lease or alter the terms and provisions contained in the Memorandum Confirming Term if so delivered to Tenant by Owner.
E. Tenant may be required to pay other charges to Owner under the terms of this Lease, such additional charges shall be referred to as ""Additional Rent"". Any Additional Rent must be paid by Tenant to Owner upon the earlier of (i) the first day of the month immediately following the month said Additional Rent is billed to Tenant or (ii) fifteen (15) days from the date Tenant is billed for the Additional Rent. If Tenant fails to pay the Additional Rent on time, Owner shall have the same rights against Tenant as if Tenant failed to pay Rent. Said Rent and Additional Rent must be paid in full in accordance with the foregoing, without deduction or offset and without the need for demand or notice from Owner. Except as may be provided for otherwise in this Article 3, all Rent and Additional Rent shall be payable to Owner by [CROSS OUT ANY FORM OF PAYMENT THAT IS INAPPLICABLE] or such other form of payment as required by Owner only. If by direct deposit, Owner shall provide Tenant the necessary wiring instructions.
F. Tenant shall be entitled to a five (5) day grace period for the payment of any sum of Rent or Additional Rent due under this Lease. Any sum of Rent or Additional Rent not paid within five (5) days of the date due shall be subject to a late fee of the lesser of (i) $50.00, or (ii) five percent (5%) of the unpaid amount. Interest shall also be payable on the aforesaid late Rent or Additional Rent beginning thirty (30) days from the due date, such interest accruing at the lesser of (i) the maximum amount allowable by law, or (ii) one and one - half percent per month (1.5%), until the late Rent or Additional Rent is paid in full. There shall be a Fifty Dollar ($50.00) fee for any check which is dishonored or returned. Any late charge or interest charge shall be considered Additional Rent.

Payment of Rent in installments is for Tenant's convenience only. If Tenant is in default under any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, Owner may give notice to Tenant that it may no longer pay Rent in installments and the entire Rent for the remaining part of the Term will then immediately be due and payable.
4. SECURITY DEPOSIT Tenant is required to give Owner the sum of $8,300.00 (such amount not to exceed one (1) months' Rent pursuant to The Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019) when Tenant signs this Lease as a security deposit (the ""Security Deposit""). Owner will deposit the Security Deposit in bank at
. This Security Deposit shall not bear interest, unless if otherwise required by applicable law. In the event that the Security Deposit shall earn interest, then in such event Owner shall be entitled to an administrative fee pursuant to applicable law.
If Tenant carries out all of Tenant's agreements in this Lease and if Tenant moves out of the Apartment and returns it to Owner vacant, broom clean and in the same condition it was in when Tenant first occupied it, except for ordinary wear and tear or damage caused by fire or other casualty through no fault of Tenant, Owner will return to Tenant the full amount of the Security Deposit within fourteen (14) days after the later of (i) the date this Lease ends, or (ii) the date Tenant vacates the Apartment.

Furthermore, for sake of clarity and emphasis, (i) if Tenant does not carry out all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, Owner may keep all or part of the Security Deposit necessary to pay Owner for any losses incurred, including missed payments and (ii) Owner's retention of the Security Deposit as allowable under this Lease shall not be deemed to be Owner's sole remedy for any default by Tenant of Tenant's obligations pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Lease.

"Please extract the type of the rental unit (e.g., apartment, studio, etc.) from the following text: 'Eldridge 245 LLC
ADDITIONAL RENT BY TENANT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, if Owner shall apply all or any portion of the Security Deposit to cure a default by Tenant hereunder during the Term of this Lease, Tenant shall, within five (5) business days, deposit with Owner that sum which shall be necessary to maintain the security in an amount equal to the Security Deposit as so required in this Article 4. Failure to replenish the Security Deposit in a timely manner shall be deemed a default under this Lease.
If Owner sells the Apartment, Owner, at its sole option, will turn over Tenant's security either to Tenant or to the person buying the Apartment within five (5) days after the sale. Owner will then notify Tenant, by registered, certified or overnight mail by a nationally recognized overnight courier, of the name and address of the person or company to whom the deposit has been turned over. In such case, Owner will have no further responsibility to Tenant for the Security Deposit and the new owner will become responsible to Tenant for the Security Deposit.
5. IF TENANT IS UNABLE TO MOVE IN Except as otherwise provided herein, Owner shall not be liable for failure to give Tenant possession of the Apartment on the Lease Commencement Date. Rent shall be payable as of the beginning of this Lease Term unless Owner is unable to give Tenant possession. A situation could arise which might prevent Owner from letting Tenant move into the Apartment on the Lease Commencement Date. If this happens for reasons beyond Owner's reasonable control, Owner will not be responsible for Tenant's damages or expenses, and this Lease will remain in effect. However, in such case, this Lease will start on the date when possession is available, and the ending date of this Lease as specified in Article 2 will remain the same (unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by Tenant and Owner). Tenant will not have to pay Rent until the date possession is available, or the date Tenant moves in, whichever is earlier (however, in no event shall Tenant move in or take possession prior to the date Owner shall have given Tenant notice that Tenant may take possession of the Apartment). Owner will notify Tenant as to the date possession is available. If Owner does not give Tenant notice that possession is available within thirty (30) days after the Lease Commencement Date, provided that Owner's failure to deliver possession is not due to a Tenant delay, Tenant may send a fifteen (15) day written termination notice (the ""Termination Notice"") to Owner, and if Owner is unable to deliver possession within fifteen (15) days of receipt of Tenant's Termination Notice, this Lease shall terminate and be o f no further force and effect and all prepaid Rent, the Security Deposit and any other fees paid by Tenant (except for non-refundable fees required in the Lease package) at the execution of this Lease shall be promptly returned to Tenant.
6. CAPTIONS In any dispute arising under this Lease, in the event of a conflict between the text and a caption, the text controls.
7. WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY
A. All of the sections of this Lease are subject to the provisions of the Warranty of Habitability Law. Under that law, Owner agrees that the Apartment is fit for human habitation and that there will be no conditions which will be detrimental to life, health or safety.
B. Tenant will do nothing to interfere with or make more difficult Owner's efforts to provide Tenant and all other occupants of the Building with the required facilities and services. Any condition caused by Tenant's misconduct or the misconduct of Tenant Parties (as hereinafter defined) or anyone else under Tenant's direction or control shall not be a breach by Owner.
8. CARE OF TENANT'S APARTMENT; END OF LEASE; MOVING OUT
A. At all times during the Term of this Lease, Tenant will take good care of the Apartment and will not permit or do any damage to it, except for damage which occurs through ordinary wear and tear. Tenant shall, at Tenant's own cost and expense, make all repairs caused or occasioned by Tenant or Tenant's agents, contractors, invitees, licensees, guests or servants (collectively hereinafter ""Tenant Parties""). In addition, Tenant shall promptly notify Owner and/or the Building Superintendent/Building Manager in writing upon the occurrence of any problem, malfunction or damage to the Apartment. Tenant will move out on or before the ending date of this Lease and leave the Apartment in good order and in the same condition as it was when Tenant first occupied it, except for ordinary wear and tear and damage caused by fire or other casualty through no fault of Tenant.
B. CLEANING. Tenant is required to use only non-abrasive cleaning agents in the Apartment. Tenant is responsible for damage done by use of any improper cleaning agents.
C. If Tenant fails to maintain the Apartment or make a needed repair or replacement as required hereunder, Owner may hire a professional and make such maintenance, repairs or replacements at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Owner's reasonable expense will be payable by Tenant to Owner as Additional Rent within ten (10) business days after Tenant receives a bill from Owner
D. When this Lease ends, Tenant must remove all of Tenant's movable property. Tenant must also remove at Tenant's own expense, any wall covering, bookcases, cabinets, mirrors, painted murals or any other installation or attachment Tenant may have installed in the Apartment, even if it was done with Owner's consent. Tenant must restore and repair to its original condition those portions of the Apartment affected by those installations and removals. Tenant has not

Renters insurance provides liability coverage to protect the Tenant in the event of his/her negligence or liability.

In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord the aforementioned property.
1) The rent shall be due on the first of every month. All payments must be mailed to:
2) I agree to accept the apartment ""as is"" having already inspected it. I further agree that Landlord has not promised to do any work in the apartment except as specified on the remarks section of this lease.
3) I understand and agree that I may not assign or sublet any part of the lease/premises without written permission from the Landlord.
4) Rent must be paid full without any deductions. Payment of less than amount stated in this lease shall be deemed nothing more than partial payments. Under no circumstances shall Landlord's acceptance of partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction nor will it forfeit Landlord's right to collect the balance due on the account, despite any endorsement, stipulation, or other statement on any check. In the event of a repair issue in the apartment, landlord will endow all efforts to certify the problem in a timely manner; however, no payments less than the amount in this lease may be deducted for any such reason. I understand that if rent is not received on time, Landlord may charge a late fee, as added rent as follows: 5 days late - $50, 10 days late - $100, 20 days late - $200. If Tenant fails to pay added rent on time, Landlord shall have the same rights against Tenant as if Tenant failed to pay rent. Rent demands from Landlord do not have to be in writing. In the event a check bounces, Tenant agrees to pay a $35 charge.

Unless otherwise provided under federal, state, or local law, no animals (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the Dwelling or Community unless we've so authorized in writing. You must remove an illegal or unauthorized animal within 24 hours of notice from us, or you will be considered in default of this Lease Contract. If we allow an animal as a pet, you must execute a separate animal addendum which may require additional deposits, rents, fees or other charges. An animal deposit is considered a general security deposit. We will authorize an assistance animal for a disabled person. When allowed by applicable laws, before we authorize an assistance animal, if the disability is not readily apparent, we may require a written statement from a qualified professional verifying the disability-related need for the assistance animal. If we authorize an assistance animal we may require you to execute a separate animal and/or assistance animal addendum. Animal deposits, additional rents, fees or other charges will not be required for an assistance animal needed due to disability, including an emotional support or service animal, as authorized under federal, state, or local law. You must not feed stray or wild animals.
If you or any guest or occupant violates animal restrictions [with or without your knowledge), you'll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease Contract. Ifan animal has been in the apartment at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we'll charge you for defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. Initial and daily animal- violation charges and animal-removal charges are liquidated damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead (except for attorney's fees and litigation costs) in enforcing animal restrictions and rules. We may remove an unauthorized animal by (1) leaving, in a conspicuous place in the apartment, a 24-hour written notice of intent to remove the animal, and (2) following the procedures of paragraph 29 (When We May Enter). We may keep or kennel the animal or turn It over to a humane society or local authority. When keeping or kenneling an animal, we won't be liable for loss, harm, sickness, or death of the animal unless due to our negligence. We'll return the animal to you upon request if it has not already been turned over to a humane society or local authority. You must pay for the animal's reasonable care and kenneling charges. We have no lien on the animal for any purpose.
29. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. §83.53, we may enter the dwelling unit at any time for the protection or preservation of the premises, in the case of an emergency, or if you unreasonably withhold consent. If you or any guest or occupant is present, then repairers, servicers, contractors, our representatives or other persons listed in (2) below may peacefully enter the apartment at
reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below. If nobody is in the apartment, then such persons may enter peacefully and at reasonable times by duplicate or master key (or by breaking a window or other means when necessary in emergencies) if:
(1) we provide you with written notice to enter at least 24 hours prior to the entry to take place between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m .; and
(2) entry is for: responding to your request; making repairs or replacements; estimating repair or refurbishing costs; performing pest control; doing preventive maintenance; changing filters; testing or replacing smoke-detector and carbon monoxide detector batteries; retrieving unreturned tools, equipment or appliances; preventing waste of utilities; exercising our contractual lien; leaving notices; delivering, installing, reconnecting, or replacing appliances, furniture, equipment, or access control devices; removing or rekeying unauthorized access control devices; removing unauthorized window coverings; stopping excessive noise; removing health or safety hazards (including hazardous materials), or items prohibited under our rules; removing perishable foodstuffs if your electricity is disconnected; removing unauthorized animals; cutting off electricity according to statute; retrieving property owned or leased by former residents; Inspecting when immediate danger to person or property is reasonably suspected; allowing persons to enter as you authorized in your rental application (if you die, are incarcerated, etc.); allowing entry by a law officer with a search or arrest warrant, or in hot pursuit; showing apartment to prospective residents (after move-out or vacate notice has been given); showing apartment to government inspectors for the limited purpose of determining housing and fire ordinance compliance by us and to lenders, appraisers, contractors, prospective buyers, or insurance agents; or any other reasonable business purpose.
30. JOINT AND SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITY. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all lease obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Our requests and notices (including sale notices) to any resident constitute notice to all residents and occupants. Notices and requests from any resident or occupant (including notices of lease termination, repair requests, and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. In eviction suits, each resident is considered the agent of all other residents in the apartment for service of process. Security-deposit refunds and deduction itemizations of multiple residents will comply with paragraph 52 (Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment).
Replacements
31. REPLACEMENTS AND SUBLETTING. Replacing a resident, sub- letting, assignment, or granting a right or license to occupy is allowed only when we expressly consent in writing.
Procedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option: (1) the replacement resident must sign this Lease Contract with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (2) the remaining and replacement residents
must sign an entirely new Lease Contract. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing resident will no longer have a right to occupancy or a security deposit refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the original Lease Contract term unless we agree otherwise in writing- even if a new Lease Contract is signed.
Responsibilities of Owner and Resident
32. RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We'll act with customary diligence to:
(1) keep common areas reasonably clean, subject to paragraph 26 (Condition of the Premises and Alterations);
(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating and A/C equipment;
(3) comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding safety, sanitation, and fair housing; and
(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay for damages for which you are liable,
If we violate any of the above or other material provisions of the lease, you may terminate this Lease Contract and exercise other remedies under state statute only as follows:
(a) you must make a written request for repair, maintenance, or remedy of the condition to us, specifying how we have failed to comply with Florida law or with the material provisions of this lease and indicating your intention to terminate the lease if the violation is not corrected within seven (7) days after delivery of the notice;
(b) after receiving the request, we have a reasonable time to repair or remedy the condition, considering the nature of the problem and the reasonable availability of materials, labor, and utilities;
(c) if our failure to comply with Florida law or material provisions of the rental agreement is due to causes beyond our control and we have made and continue to make every reasonable effort to correct the failure to comply, you may also exercise other statutory remedies.
All rent must be current at the time you give us notice of noncompliance,
Recycling Program Disclosure Notification. Where required, this property participates in a recycling program that conforms to all applicable law(s) and general information, education and/or guidelines pertaining to our recycling program will be provided to you.
33, DEFAULT BY RESIDENT. You'll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don't pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you or any guest or occupant violates this Lease Contract, apartment rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (3) you abandon the apartment; (4) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application;

If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property.

We're not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law-enforcement agency.

Building, Housing, or Health Codes. We will comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes. If there are no applicable building, housing, or health codes, we will maintain the roofs, windows, screens, doors, floors, steps, porches, exterior walls, foundations, and all other structural components in good repair and capable of resisting normal forces and loads, and the plumbing in reasonable working condition. However, we are not responsible for the repair of conditions created or caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of you, a member of your family, or any other person on the premises, in the apartment, or in the common areas of the apartment community with your consent.

Unless authorized by statute or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are allowed inside or outside the apartment. But we'll permit a reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of wood-paneled walis, unless our rules state otherwise. No water furniture, washing machines, additional phone or TV-cable outlets, alarm systems, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless statutorily allowed or we've consented in writing. You may

Your improvements and/or added fixtures to the apartment (whether or not we consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.
Liens for Improvements. The interest of the Owner/Landlord shall not be subject to liens for improvements made by the Tenant(s) or Tenant(s)' contractors as provided in Section 713.10, Florida Statutes. You shall notify all parties performing work on the premises at your request that the Lease DOES NOT allow any liens to attach to Landlord's/Owner's interest, and the knowing or willful failure to provide such notice to the contractor shall render the contract between you and the contractor voidable at the option of the contractor. Any violation of this provision constitutes a material breach and default of the lease entitling us to terminate your Lease and/or to seek all remedies available under this Lease and law.
Pest Control. We will make reasonable provisions for the extermination of rats, mice, roaches, ants, wood destroying organisms, and bed bugs. If you are required to vacate the premises for such extermination, we shall not be liable for damages, but rent shall be abated. If you are required to vacate in order to perform pest control or extermination services, you will be given seven (7) days written notice of the necessity to vacate, and you will not be required to vacate for more than four (4) days. We may still enter your apartment as provided in Paragraph 29 (When We May Enter) of this Lease and F.S. 83.53 or upon 24 hours notice to perform pest control or extermination services which do not require you to vacate the premises. You must comply with all applicable provisions of building, housing and health codes and maintain the apartment and adjacent common areas in a clean and sanitary manner. You must properly dispose of and promptly remove all of your garbage so as to prevent foul odors, unsanitary conditions, or infestation of pests and vermin in your apartment, adjacent common areas (such as breezeways), and other common areas of the apartment community.
Waterbeds. You are allowed to have a waterbed or flotation bedding systems provided it complies with any applicable building codes and provided that you carry flotation or renter's insurance which covers any damages which occur as a result of using the waterbed or flotation bedding system. You must provide us with a copy of the policy upon request. You must also name us as an additional insured at our request.
27. REQUESTS, REPAIRS, AND MALFUNCTIONS.

Our written notes on your oral request do not constitute a written request from you.
Our complying with or responding to any oral request regarding security or non-security matters doesn't waive the strictrequirement for written notices under this Lease Contract. You must promptly notify us in writing of: water leaks; electrical problems; malfunctioning lights; broken or missing locks or latches; and other conditions that pose a hazard to property, health, or safety. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the apartment if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to avoid property damage or to perform work. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. Air conditioning problems are not emergencies. If air conditioning or other equipment malfunctions, you must notify our representative as soon as possible on a business day. We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.
If we believe that fire, catastrophic damage, extermination issues, mold and mildew or any habitability issues whatsoever is substantial, or that performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, we may terminate this Lease Contract within a reasonable time by giving you written notice.

"Please extract the name of the tenant from the following text: '(5) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia under state statute; or (6) any illegal drugs or paraphernalia are found in your apartment.
Termination of Rental Agreement - Your Failure to Pay Rent Due. If you default by failing to pay rent when due and the default continues for three (3) days, not counting Saturday, Sunday, and court-observed legal holidays, after delivery of a written demand for payment of the rent or possession of the premises, we may terminate the rental agreement. Termination of this lease for non- payment of rent, or termination of your possession rights, filing of an action for possession, eviction, issuance of a writ of possession, or subsequent reletting doesn't release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations.
Termination of Rental Agreement - Your Failure to Comply with F.S. 83.52 or Material Provisions of the Lease.
(1) If you default by materially failing to comply with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of this lease, the rules and regulations, or any addenda (other than failure to pay rent due), and the non-compliance is of a nature that YOU SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE or if your non- compliance CONSTITUTES A SECOND OR CONTINUING NON- COMPLIANCE WITHIN TWELVE (12) MONTHS OF A SIMILAR VIOLATION, we may terminate the lease by delivering written notice specifying the nature of the non-compliance and our intention to terminate the lease. Upon receiving such a lease termination notice without opportunity to cure or constituting a second violation within 12 months, you will have seven (7) days from delivery of the notice to vacate the apartment and premises. Examples of non-compliance which are without opportunity to cure include, but are not limited to, destruction, damage, or misuse of our or other resident's property by your intentional acts or a subsequent or continued unreasonable disturbance.
(2) If you default by materially failing to comply with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of this lease, the rules and regulations, or any addenda (other than failure to pay rent due), and the non-compliance is of a nature that YOU SHOULD be given an opportunity to cure it, we may deliver a written notice to you specifying the nature of the non-compliance and notifying you that unless the non-compliance is corrected within seven (7) days of delivery of the notice, we may terminate the lease. If you fail to correct the violation within seven (7) days of receiving such notice or if you repeat same conduct or conduct of a similar nature within a twelve (12) month period, we may terminate your lease without giving you any further opportunity to cure the non-compliance as provided above. Examples of non-compliance in which we will give you an opportunity to cure the violation include, but are not limited to, unauthorized pets, guests, or vehicles, parking in an unauthorized manner, or failing to keep the apartment and premises clean and sanitary. We will also have all rights under Florida law and this lease to tow or remove improperly parked vehicles in addition to our remedy of terminating the lease for such violations.
Termination of this lease for non-compliance with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of the lease, termination of your possession rights, filing of an action for possession, eviction, issuance of a writ of possession, or subsequent reletting doesn't release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations.
Holdover. You or any occupant, invitee, or guest must not hold over beyond the date contained in your move-out notice or our notice to vacate (or beyond a different move-out date agreed to by the parties in writing). If a holdover occurs, then: (1) holdover rent
is due in advance on a daily basis and may become delinquent without notice or demand; (2) we may file a holdover eviction lawsuit pursuant to Fla, Stat. §83.58 to recover possession of the dwelling unit, double the amount of rent due for each day that you continue to holdover and refuse to surrender possession during the holdover period, breach of contract damages, attorney fees and court costs as may be applicable; or (3) at our option, we may extend the Lease Contract term-for up to one month from the date of notice of Lease Contract extension-by delivering written notice to you or your apartment while you continue to hold over.
Other Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit agencies. If we, or a third-party debt collector we use, try to collect any money you owe us, you agree that we or the debt collector may call you on your cell phone and may use an automated dialer. If you default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to be rental discounts in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), in addition to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal remedies under state statute. Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, sentimental or personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the non-prevailing party attorney's fees and all other litigation costs. Attorney fees and all other expenses shall be deemed ""costs"". Late charges are liquidated damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead in collecting late rent (but are not for attorney's fees and litigation costs). All unpaid amounts bear 18% interest per year from due date, compounded annually. You must pay all collection-agency fees if you fail to pay all sums due within 10 days after we mail you a letter demanding payment and stating that collection agency fees will be added if you don't pay all sums by that deadline. Unless modified by Addendum, you will also be liable for all of our actual damages related to your breach of the Lease Contract.
Choice of Remedies and Mitigation of Damages. If you move out early, you'll be subject to paragraph 11 (Early Move-Out) and all other remedies. If we regain possession of the apartment as a result of your breach of the lease, or because you surrendered possession of the apartment, or because you abandoned possession of the apartment, or because we obtained possession through eviction proceedings, unless modified by Addendum, we may either (a) treat the lease as terminated and re-take possession FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT; (b) re-take possession of the apartment FOR YOUR ACCOUNT and attempt in good faith to re-let it on your behalf; or (c) take no action to obtain possession or re-let the apartment and continue to collect rent from you as it comes due. If we take possession of the apartment for our own account, then you will have no further liability for rents under the remainder of the lease. If we take possession of the apartment for your account and attempt to re-let it, you will remain liable for the difference between the rental remaining due under the lease and the amount we are able to recover by making a good faith effort at re-letting the premises on your behalf. We are not required to make an election of which remedies we choose to pursue nor notify you of which remedies we will select.
Lease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred. In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a default under this Lease, We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said subsequent Lease.
Remedies Cumulative. Except where limited or prohibited by law, any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.
General Clauses
34. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. You understand and acknowledge that neither we nor any of our representatives have authority to make any statements, promises or representations in conflict with or in addition to the information contained in this Lease Contract or by a separate written agreement signed by you and us, and we hereby specifically disclaim any responsibility for any such statements, promises or representations.

If, at least 5 days before the advance notice deadline referred to in paragraph 3 (Lease Term and Termination Notice Requirements), we give you written notice of rent increases or lease changes effective when the lease term or renewal period ends, this Lease Contract will automatically continue month-to-month with the increased rent or lease changes. The new modified Lease Contract will begin on the date stated in the notice (without necessity of your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under paragraph 47 (Move-Out Notice).
16. DELAY OF OCCUPANCY. If occupancy is or will be delayed for construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident's holding over, we're not responsible for the delay. The Lease Contract will remain in force subject to: (1) abatement of rent on a daily basis during delay; and (2) your right to terminate as set forth below. Termination notice must be in writing. After termination, you are entitled only to refund of deposit(s) and any rent paid. Rent abatement or Lease Contract termination does not apply if delay is for cleaning or repairs that don't prevent you from occupying the apartment.
If there is a delay and we haven't given notice of delay as set forth immediately below, you may terminate up to the date when the apartment is ready for occupancy, but not later.
(1) If we give written notice to any of you when or after the initial term as set forth in Paragraph 3 (Lease Term and Termination Notice Requirements)-and the notice states that occupancy has been delayed because of construction or a previous resident's holding over, and that the apartment will be ready on a specific date-you may terminate the Lease Contract within 3 days of your receiving the notice, but not later.
(2) If we give written notice to any of you before the initial term as set forth in Paragraph 3 (Lease Term and Termination Notice Requirements) and the notice states that construction delay is expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease Contract within 7 days after any of you receives written notice, but not later. The readiness date is considered the new initial term as set forth in Paragraph 3 (Lease Term and Termination Notice Requirements) for all purposes. This new date may not be moved to an earlier date unless we and you agree.
17. AD VALOREM TAXES/FEES AND CHARGES - ADDITIONAL RENT. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if, during the term of this Lease, any locality, city, state, or Federal Government imposes upon Us, any fee, charge, or tax, which is related to or charged by the number of occupants, or by the dwelling unit itself, such that we are charged a fee, charge, or tax, based upon your use or occupancy of the dwelling unit, we may add this charge as Additional Rent, during the term of the Lease Contract, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to you. After this written notice (the amount or approximate amount of the charge, will be included), you agree to pay, as Additional Rent, the amount of the charge, tax or fee imposed upon

our prior written permission. You must not withhold or offset rent unless authorized by statute. We may, at our option, require at any time that you pay all rent and other sums in cash, certified or cashier's check, money order, or one monthly check rather than multiple checks. At our discretion, we may convert any and all checks via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system for the purposes of collecting payment. Rent is not considered accepted, if the payment/ACH is rejected, does not clear, or is stopped for any reason. We may, but are not required to, accept rent through direct debit, ACH or other electronic means established and approved by us.

We'll also have all other remedies for such violation. All payment obligations under this Lease Contract shall constitute rent under this Lease Contract.
We and you agree that the failure to pay rent timely or the violation of the animal restrictions results in added administrative expenses and added costs to us, the same as if we had to borrow money to pay the operating costs of the property necessary to cover such added costs. We both agree that the late fee and animal violations provisions are intended to be liquidated damages since the added costs of late payments and damages in such instances are difficult to determine. We also both agree that the amount of late rent and animal violation fees charged are reasonable estimates of the administrative expenses, costs, and damages we would incur in such instances.
All of the foregoing charges will be considered to be additional rent.

Cable channels that are provided may be changed during the lease term if the change applies to all residents. Utilities may be used only for normal household purposes and must not be wasted. If your electricity is ever interrupted, you must use only battery-operated lighting. If any utilities are submetered for the apartment, or prorated by an allocation formula, we will attach an addendum to this Lease Contract in compliance with state agency rules or city ordinance. Resident shall not heat the apartment using gas-operated stoves or ovens which were intended for use in cooking.
Where lawful, all utilities, charges and fees of any kind under this lease shall be considered additional rent, and if partial payments are accepted by the Landlord, they will be allocated first to non-rent charges and to rent last. Failure to maintain utilities as required herein is a material violation of the Lease and may result in termination of tenancy, eviction and/or any other remedies under the Lease and Florida law.
8. INSURANCE. We do not maintain insurance to cover your personal property or personal injury. We are not responsible to any resident, guest, or occupant for damage or loss of personal property or personal injury from (including but not limited to) fire, smoke, rain, flood, water and pipe leaks, hail, ice, snow, lightning, wind, explosions, earthquake, interruption of utilities, theft, hurricane, negligence of other residents, occupants, or invited/uninvited guests or vandalism unless otherwise required by law.

50. MOVE-OUT INSPECTION. You should meet with our representative for a move-out inspection.

"Please extract the name of the tenant from the following text: 'Landlord reserves the right to modify the method used to charge Resident, in Landlord's reasonable discretion.
Submetered Utilities: Billings based on submeter readings (if any) will itemize the beginning and ending meter readings, the rate charged to Resident, and all categories of information that appear within the utility's standard billing format to the Landlord. If the Premises are submetered, Resident agrees to allow Landlord, or a billing service provider Landlord designates, access to the Premises to install, repair, remove and read submeters. Billing amounts based on submeter reading will be determined by dividing the total master bill according to submeter readings.
Both Flat and Variable Utility Reimbursement is administered by Landlord Billing: Landlord bills utilities to Resident. The payment instructions on Lease Agreement apply to utility billings as well as to any other payments due from Resident to Landlord, except as modified below. The due date for Rent and utility charges may not coincide. Resident's failure to pay the utility charges by their due date will be considered a material breach of the Agreement, grounds for termination of the tenancy, and if allowed by law, we may discontinue providing the utilities to you. Utility billings will be prorated as necessary. Each bill will include a monthly service fee of $5.00 to compensate Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company to pay and communicate with utility providers, read the meters and/or submeters, calculate and allocate utility fees, provide billing services, and otherwise address utility issues.
Utility Late Fees/Transfer Penalty: Resident must make payment in full to Landlord or the Utility Billing Company of the utility charges before the due date listed on each bill. Landlord and Resident agree that the actual cost to Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company when Resident fails to pay the utility bill on time is difficult or impossible to ascertain, but the parties agree that Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company will incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, additional charges, costs in printing and mailing late notices, and lost opportunity costs of the payment. Accordingly, Landlord and Resident agree that if the utility payment is not paid by the due date and/ or resident fails to transition utility to Resident's name as utility customer of record when required, then Resident will incur a utility late fee and/ or utility transfer penalty fee of $25.00. Resident will also be responsible for reimbursement of utility bill charges received by Landlord for failure to put utilities into Resident's name.

(2) The rent provided for in this Lease may be increased or decreased retroactively to the commencement of the Lease to conform to the lawful Rent Guidelines or any changes in the Guidelines which apply to this Lease as issued by the N.Y.C. Rent Guidelines board or appropriate county rent guidelines board.
(3) This Lease and all riders shall continue in full force and effect, and except as modified above, shall in no way be affected by this section.
33. Representations, changes in Lease. Tenant has read this Lease and acknowledges receipt of the Lease, the lead paint rider booklet - Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home, Disclosure of Information on Lead- Based Paint and Lead-Based Paint Hazards, Window Guard Notice & the Rent Stabilization Lease Rider, if applicable, For Apartment House Tenants Residing in New York City. All promises made by the Landlord are in this Lease. There are no other. This Lease may be changed only by an agreement in writing signed by and delivered to each party. Tenant is neither in the U.S. Military nor dependent on someone who is.
34. Utilities and other charges. It is understood that rent does not include any utilities (i.e. heat, electricity etc.) for the Apartment. Tenant is responsible to arrange and pay for heat for his/her unit.
35. Rent and Additional Rent. It is understood that the annual rent for the space is $72,000.00; however due to the economic condition, rent will for the term of this lease be discounted to a preferential rent of the amount stated on page one of this lease, provided that the Tenant is not in default of any covenants of this Lease, and pays preferential rent on a timely basis, which should be paid in advance on the first day of each and every calendar month during said term, except the first installment which shall be paid upon the execution hereof.
Tenant acknowledges that this agreement of preferential rent shall in no way affect the monthly legal regulated rent for the subject space. The preferential rent applies to the current lease term only. At the option of the landlord, future renewal and vacancy leases for this space may be based upon either such preferential rent or an amount not more than the previously established legal regulated rent, as adjusted by the applicable guidelines and other increases authorized by law. The preferential rent is personal to the tenant named in the lease only and will not benefit the tenant's successors or assigns. Tenant shall pay the preferential rent to the Landlord at the Landlord's address. If the Tenant fails to comply with any agreement in this lease, the Landlord may do so on behalf of the Tenant. The Landlord may charge the cost to comply, including legal and attorney's fees and penalties, to the Tenant as ""additional rent"". The additional rent shall be due and payable as Rent with the next monthly Preferential Rent payment. Non-payment of additional rent shall give the Landlord the same rights against the Tenant as if the Tenant failed to pay the preferential rent.
Tenant will make all rental payments in full. Payment or receipt of a rental payment of less than the amount stated
in the lease shall be deemed to be nothing more than partial payment. Under no circumstances shall Landlord's acceptance of partial payment constitute accord and satisfaction. Nor will Landlord's acceptance of partial payment forfeit Landlord's right to collect the balance due on the account, despite any endorsement, stipulation, or any other statement on the check or receipt. Money paid by Tenant to Landlord can be applied to Tenant's account in the following order: first to outstanding late fees and returned check fees; second to outstanding legal fees and/ or court costs legally chargeable to Tenant; third to current month rent; fourth to arrears.
It is agreed that if Landlord will file for a J51 Tax Abatement, and if that will result in the premises to be subject to rent stabilization, it is expressly understood that premises will be subject to rent stabilization only for the duration of the tax abatement and the unit shall be destabilized after the expiration of the tax abatement.
All cost and expenses, which Tenants assumes or agrees to pay pursuant to this lease, shall be treated as additional rents and in the event of non-payment, Landlord shall have the right and remedies herein provided for in a case of non- payment of rent. If tenant fails to pay rent on time landlord is authorized to present automated clearing house debits. This clearing house authorization cannot be revoked until all tenant obligations under this lease agreement is satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this lease, Tenant agrees that if Tenant shall make default in fulfilling any of the covenants of this lease, including the payment of rent or ""additional rent"" or if the demised premises become vacant or deserted, the Landlord may give to the Tenant ten days' notice of intention to end the term of this lease, and thereupon at the expiration of said ten days' the term under this lease shall expire as fully and completely as if that day were the date herein definitely fixed for the expiration of the term and the Tenant will then quit and surrender the demised premises to the Landlord, but the Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided. Proof of mailing shall be considered as proof of proper notice.
36. Mold Addendum. Tenant acknowledges that it is necessary for Tenant to maintain appropriate climate control, keep rental space clean, and take necessary measures to retard and prevent mold from accumulating in the rental space. Tenant agrees to clean and dust the rental space on a regular basis and to remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, window sills, walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Tenant agrees not to block or cover any heating, ventilation or air-conditioning ducts. Tenant also agrees to report immediately in writing to Landlord: (i) any evidence of a water leak or excessive moisture in the unit, common hallways, storage room, garage or other common area; (ii) any evidence of mold that cannot be removed with a common household cleaner; (iii) any failure or malfunction in heating, ventilation or air conditioning, and (iv) any inoperable doors or windows.

"Please extract whether the lease will automatically renew or not from the following text: '(d) If neither party ends the Lease or changes the Lease at the end of the original Term or of any renewal term, as set forth in 16(a) or (b), this Lease will automatically renew for one (1) year. Automatic renewal will not change the terms of this Lease except that the rent for each renewal term is increased.
(e) If Tenant vacates the apartment prior to the end of the lease term and thereby breaches the lease agreement, Tenant shall pay an Early Lease Termination Charge. This charge shall be in addition to any damages to Tenant's apartment incurred by Landlord during occupancy of Tenant. The charge shall be equal to two (2) times the regular Base Monthly Rent. The Early Termination Charge and any outstanding rent or other charges must be paid no later than the day you vacate the Apartment and provide the keys to the Landlord, thereby returning possession of the Apartment to the Landlord. This charge is based on the present inability to determine the exact damages, lost rent or other costs that the Landlord would incur by the early termination of the lease by Tenant. It is agreed between the parties that this fee is reasonable based on Landlord allowing the Tenant to terminate the lease and vacate the premises prior to its termination date.
(f) Should the Tenant fail to vacate at the end of the term, or should the Tenant fail to vacate after the resident gives notice that they will vacate (whether they are in breach of this lease or not), resident shall pay double the last monthly rent charge. Tenant will be responsible for damages flowing from the breach of this lease by the resident's failure to vacate in accordance with the lease. Such damages shall be deemed collectable as additional rent. The landlord can also pursue all remedies available at Law.
(g) This Lease will not automatically renew if Tenant is in default at any time within seventy (70) days from the date of the end of the term. In that event, the Lease will automatically end at the end of that term.
17. LANDLORD'S REMEDIES.
Tenant is in breach of this Lease if Tenant fails to make rental payments when due or fails to comply with any other provision of this Lease. If Tenant breaches this Lease:
(a) Tenant must immediately pay all rents for the balance of the term of this Lease and Landlord may sue for this rent.
(b) Landlord may end this Lease.
(c) Landlord may evict Tenant.
(d) Landlord may sue Tenant to collect any monies due including but not limited to legal fees and costs to enforce lease terms. Tenant agrees to pay all legal fees and costs.

"Please extract whether the lease will automatically renew or not from the following text: 'LEASE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. Definitions. The following terms are commonly used in this Lease:
1.1. ""Residents"" are those listed in ""Residents"" above who sign the Lease and are authorized to live in the apartment.
1.2. ""Occupants"" are those listed in this Lease who are also autho- rized to live in the apartment, but who do not sign the Lease.
1.3. ""Owner"" may be identified by an assumed name and is the owner only and not property managers or anyone else.
1.4. ""Including"" in this Lease means ""including but not limited to.""
1.5. ""Community Policies"" are the written apartment rules and policies, including property signage and instructions for care of our property and amenities, with which you, your occupants, and your guests must comply.
1.6. ""Rent"" is monthly base rent plus additional monthly recurring fixed charges.
2. Apartment. You are leasing the apartment listed above for use as a private residence only.
2.1. Access. In accordance with our Community Policies, you'll receive access information or devices for your apartment and mailbox, and other access devices including:
2.2. Measurements. Any dimensions and sizes provided to you relating to the apartment are only approximations or estimates; actual dimensions and sizes may vary.
2.3. Representations. You agree that designations or accredi- tations associated with the property are subject to change.
3. Rent. You must pay your Rent on or before the 1st day of each month (due date) without demand. There are no exceptions regarding the payment of Rent, and you agree not paying Rent on or before the 1st of each month is a material breach of this Lease.
3.1. Payments. You will pay your Rent by any method, manner and place we specify in accordance with our Community Policies. Cash is not acceptable without our prior written permission. You cannot withhold or offset Rent unless authorized by law. We may, at our option, require at any time that you pay Rent and other sums due in one single payment by any method we specify.
3.2. Application of Payments. Payment of each sum due is an independent covenant, which means payments are due regardless of our performance. When we receive money, other than water and wastewater payments subject to government regulation, we may apply it at our option and without notice first to any of your unpaid obligations, then to accrued rent. We may do so regardless of notations on checks or money orders and regardless of when the obligations arose. All sums other than Rent and late fees are due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have to accept any payments.
3.3. Late Fees. If we don't receive your monthly base rent in full when it's due, you must pay late fees as outlined in Lease Details.
3.4. Returned Payment Fee. You'll pay the fee listed in Lease Details for each returned check or rejected electronic payment, plus initial and daily late fees if applicable, until we receive full payment in an acceptable method.
3.5. Utilities and Services. You'll pay for all utilities and services, related deposits, and any charges or fees when they are due and as outlined in this Lease. Television channels that are provided may be changed during the Lease term if the change applies to all residents.
If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only battery- operated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any utilities (other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or switched for any reason-including disconnection for not paying your bills-until the Lease term or renewal period ends. If a utility is individually metered, it must be connected in your name and you must notify the provider of your move- out date. If you delay getting service turned on in your name by the Lease's start date or cause it to be transferred back into our name before you surrender or abandon the apartment, you'll be liable for the charge listed above (not to exceed $50 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated cost of the utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you. If your apartment is individually metered and you change your retail electric provider, you must give us written notice. You must pay all applicable provider fees, including any fees to change service back into our name after you move out.
3.6. Lease Changes. Lease changes are only allowed during the Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specified in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us. At or after the end of the initial Lease term, Rent increases will become effective with at least 5 days plus the number of days' advance notice contained in Box F on page 1 in writing from us to you. Your new Lease, which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current Lease term or renewal period.
4. Automatic Lease Renewal and Notice of Termination. This Lease will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives written notice of termination or intent to move out as required by Par. 25 and specified on page 1. If the number of days isn't filled in, no- tice of at least 30 days is required.
5. Security Deposit. The total security deposit for all residents is due on or before the date this Lease is signed. Any animal deposit will be designated in an animal addendum. Security deposits may not be ap- plied to Rent without our prior written consent.
5.1. Refunds and Deductions. You must give us your advance notice of move out as provided by Par. 25 and forwarding address in writing to receive a written description and itemized list of charges or refund. In accordance with our Community Policies and as allowed by law, we may deduct from your security deposit any amounts due under the Lease. If you move out early or in response to a notice to vacate, you'll be liable for rekeying charges. Upon receipt of your move-out date and forwarding address in writing, the security deposit will be returned (less lawful deductions) with an itemized accounting of any deductions, no later than 30 days after surrender or abandonment, unless laws provide otherwise. Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable to all residents and distributed to any one resident we choose, or distributed equally among all residents.
6. Insurance. Our insurance doesn't cover the loss of or damage to your personal property. You will be required to have liability insur- ance as specified in our Community Policies or Lease addenda un- less otherwise prohibited by law. If you have insurance covering the apartment or your personal belongings at the time you or we suffer or allege a loss, you agree to require your insurance carrier to waive any insurance subrogation rights. Even if not required, we urge you to obtain your own insurance for losses due to theft, fire, flood, water, pipe leaks and similar occurrences. Most renter's insurance policies don't cover losses due to a flood.
7. Reletting and Early Lease Termination. This Lease may not be ter- minated early except as provided in this Lease.
7.1. Reletting Charge. You'll be liable for a reletting charge as listed in Lease Details, (not to exceed 85% of the highest monthly Rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in, or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 25; (B) move out without paying Rent in full for the entire Lease term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because of your default; or (D) are judicially evicted. The reletting charge is not a termination, cancellation or buyout fee and does not release you from your obligations under this Lease, including liability for future or past-due Rent, charges for damages or other sums due.
The reletting charge is a liquidated amount covering only part of our damages-for our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing a replacement resident. These damages are uncertain and hard to ascertain-particularly those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising, showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking pros- pects, overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees. You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of our damages and that the charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed.
7.2. Early Lease Termination Procedures. In addition to your termination rights referred to in 7.3 or 8.1 below, if this provision applies under Lease Details, you may terminate the Lease prior to the end of the Lease term if all of the following occur: (a) as outlined in Lease Details, you give us written notice of early termination, pay the early termination fee and specify the date by which you'll move out; (b) you are not in default at any time and do not hold over; and (c) you repay all rent concessions, credits or discounts you received during the Lease term. If you are in default, the Lease remedies apply.
7.3. Special Termination Rights. You may have the right under Texas law to terminate the Lease early in certain situations involving military deployment or transfer, family violence, certain sexual offenses, stalking or death of a sole resident.
8. Delay of Occupancy. We are not responsible for any delay of your occupancy caused by construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident's holding over. This Lease will remain in force subject to (1) abatement of Rent on a daily basis during delay, and (2) your right to terminate the Lease in writing as set forth below. Rent abatement and Lease termination do not apply if the delay is for cleaning or re- pairs that don't prevent you from moving into the apartment.
8.1. Termination. If we give written notice to you of a delay in occupancy when or after the Lease begins, you may termi- nate the Lease within 3 days after you receive written notice. If we give you written notice before the date the Lease begins and the notice states that a construction or other delay is expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease within 7 days after receiving written notice.
After proper termination, you are entitled only to refund of any deposit(s) and any Rent you paid.

The term ""in the housing"" below means either inside or outside the housing unit.)
LEAD-FREE HOUSING If the housing unit has been certified as ""lead free"" according to 24 CFR Section 35.82, the lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazard regulations do not apply, and it is not necessary to provide this addendum, or a lead-based paint warning pamphlet and lead-based paint disclosure statement, to the lessee (resident).

IMPORTANT!
Lead From Paint, Dust, and Soil in and Around Your Home Can Be Dangerous if Not Managed Properly
. Children under 6 years old are most at risk for lead poisoning in your home.
. Lead exposure can harm young children and babies even before they are born.
. Homes, schools, and child care facilities built before 1978 are likely to contain lead-based paint.
. Even children who seem healthy may have dangerous levels of lead in their bodies.
. Disturbing surfaces with lead-based paint or removing lead-based paint improperly can increase the danger to your family.
. People can get lead into their bodies by breathing or swallowing lead dust, or by eating soil or paint chips containing lead.
. People have many options for reducing lead hazards. Generally, lead-based paint that is in good condition is not a hazard (see page 10).

(1) 48-hour written notice is required to conduct an inspection of the Premises prior to the Tenant moving out, unless the Tenant waives the right to such notice.
(2) If Housing Provider has in writing informed Tenant that the Premises are for sale and that Tenant will be notified orally to show the premises (C.A.R. Form NSE), then, for the next 120 days following the delivery of the NSE, notice may be given orally to show the Premises to actual or prospective purchasers.
(3) No written notice is required if Housing Provider and Tenant orally agree to an entry for agreed services or repairs if the date and time of entry are within one week of the oral agreement.

Any proposed assignee, transferee or sublessee shall submit to Housing Provider an application and credit information for Housing Provider's approval and, if approved, sign a separate written agreement with Housing Provider and Tenant. Housing Provider's consent to any one assignment, transfer or sublease, shall not be construed as consent to any subsequent assignment, transfer or sublease and does not release Tenant of Tenant's obligations under this Agreement.
B.
This prohibition also applies ( arranged through AirBnB, VRBO, HomeAway or other short term rental services. :unselected: does not apply) to short term, vacation, and transient rentals such as, but not limited to, those C.

"Please extract the name of the tenant from the following text: '(5) To occupy the dwelling as his abode, utilizing portions thereof for living, sleeping, cooking or dining purposes only which were respectively designed or intended to be used for such occupancies.
26.CONDITION OF THE PREMISES AND ALTERATIONS. You accept the dwelling, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for conditions causing the premises to be untenantable under California Civil Code 1941. You'll be given an Inventory and Condition form on or before move-in. You must note on the form all defects or damage and return it to our representative. Otherwise, everything will be considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working condition.
You must use customary diligence in maintaining the dwelling and not damaging or littering the Community. Unless authorized by statute or by us in writing, you must not perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, electrical changes, or otherwise alter the dwelling or Community. No holes or stickers are allowed inside or outside the dwelling. But we'll permit a reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of wood-paneled walls, unless our rules state otherwise. No water furniture, washing machines, additional phone or TV-cable outlets, alarm systems, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless permission is statutorily required or we've consented in writing. You may install a satellite dish or antenna provided you sign our satellite dish or antenna lease addendum which complies with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You agree not to alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, furniture, telephone and cable TV wiring, screens, locks, and access control devices. When you move in, we'll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish, including exterior fixtures operated from inside the dwelling; after that, you'll replace them at your expense with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements to the dwelling (whether or not we consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.
27. REQUESTS, REPAIRS, AND MALFUNCTIONS. IF YOU OR ANY OCCUPANT NEEDS TO SEND A NOTICE OR REQUEST-FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REPAIRS, INSTALLATIONS, SERVICES, OR SECURITY-RELATED MATTERS-IT MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH EITHER THE ONLINE TENANT/MAINTENANCE PORTAL, OR SIGNED AND IN WRITING AND DELIVERED TO OUR DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE. (except in case of fire, smoke, gas, explosion, overflowing sewage, uncontrollable running water, electrical shorts, or crime in progress). Our written notes on your oral request do not constitute a written request from you.
Our complying with or responding to any oral request regarding security or non-security matters doesn't waive the strict requirement for written notices under this Lease Contract. You must promptly notify us in writing of: water leaks; electrical problems; malfunctioning lights; broken or missing locks or latches; and other conditions that pose a hazard to property, health, or safety. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the dwelling if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to avoid property damage or to perform work. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. Air conditioning problems are not emergencies. If air conditioning or other equipment malfunctions, you must notify our representative as soon as possible on a business day. We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.
If we believe that fire or catastrophic damage is substantial, or that performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, we may terminate your tenancy within a reasonable time by giving you written notice. If your tenancy is so terminated, we'll refund prorated rent and all deposits, less lawful deductions.
28.ANIMALS. Unless otherwise provided under federal, state, or local law, no animals (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the Dwelling Unit or Community unless we've so authorized in writing. You must remove an illegal or unauthorized animal within 24 hours of notice from us, or you will be considered in default of this Lease Contact. If we allow an animal as a pet, you must execute a separate animal addendum which may require additional deposits, rents, fees or other charges. An animal deposit is considered a general security deposit. We will authorize an assistance animal for a disabled person. When allowed by applicable laws, before we authorize an assistance animal, if the disability is not readily apparent, we may require a written statement from a qualified
professional verifying the disability-related need for the assistance animal. If we authorize an assistance animal we may require you to execute a separate animal and/or assistance animal addendum. Animal deposits, additional rents, fees or other charges will not be required for an assistance animal needed due to disability, including an emotional support or service animal, as authorized under federal, state, or local law. If you or any guest or occupant violates the animal restrictions (with or without your knowledge), you'll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease Contract. If an animal has been in the dwelling unit at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we'll charge you for any necessary defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing. You must not feed stray or wild animals.
29. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. Landlord will have the right to enter the premises as allowed by law. Law permits entry in case of emergency to make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, to test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen or contractors or to make an inspection pursuant to subdivision (f) of Civil Code §1950.5, when the Resident has abandoned or surrendered the premises and pursuant to court order. Landlord will serve Resident with written notice before entry unless:
· Entry is due to an emergency, surrender or abandonment of the unit, or
· Resident and Landlord agree orally to an entry to make agreed repairs or supply agreed services at an approximate day and time within one week of the oral agreement, or
· Resident is present and consents to entry at the time of entry, or
· To exhibit the unit to prospective or actual purchasers of the property, provided that Landlord has notified Resident in writing within 120 days of the oral notice that the property is for sale and that Resident may be contacted to allow for an inspection.
· Entry to inspect a tenant's dwelling unit shall comply with Section 1954. Entry to inspect any unit selected by the pest control operator and to conduct followup inspections of surrounding units until bed bugs are eliminated is a necessary service for the purpose of Section 1954. Tenants shall cooperate with the inspection to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs, including providing requested information that is necessary to facilitate the detection and treatment of bed bugs to the pest control operator.
The landlord shall notify the tenants of those units inspected by the pest control operator pursuant to Section 1954.604 of the pest control operator's findings. The notification shall be in writing and made within two business days of receipt of the pest control operator's findings. For confirmed infestations in common areas, all tenants shall be provided notice of the pest control operator's findings.
30. JOINT AND SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITY. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all Lease Contract obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Our requests and notices (including sale notices) to any resident constitute notice to all residents and occupants. Notices and requests from any resident or occupant (including notices of lease termination, repair requests, and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. Security-deposit refunds and deduction itemizations of multiple residents will comply with paragraph 53 (Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment).
31.ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING. You may not assign or sublet any portion or the entire dwelling, except to the extent required by law. We intend this to be a strict and absolute prohibition against subletting and assignment. We will not acknowledge, communicate, or accept rent from any person other than you. All guests, residents, occupants, subtenants, or assignees in the dwelling must comply with every term of this Lease. If you no longer permanently reside in the dwelling, we reserve the right to raise the rent and collect rent from any subsequent occupants. You must notify us in writing if you no longer permanently reside in the dwelling, or if it is no longer your principal place of occupancy. You may still be liable for the entire Lease Contract term if you move out early (see paragraph 48 Move-Out Notice).

This may include calls made to your cellular telephone using an automatic telephone dialing system, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, text messages, mail, e-mail, and calls to your phone or Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) service, or any other data or voice transmission technology. You agree to promptly notify us if you change any contact information you provide to us. You are responsible for any service provider charges as a result of us contacting you.
43.OBLIGATION TO VACATE. If we provide you with a notice to vacate, or if you provide us with a written notice to vacate or intent to move-out in accordance with paragraph 3 (Lease Term), and we accept such written notice, then you are required to vacate the dwelling and remove all of your personal property therefrom at the expiration of the Lease term, or by the date set forth in the notice to vacate, whichever date is earlier, without further notice or demand from us.
44.FORCE MAJEURE. If we are prevented from completing performances of any obligations hereunder by an act of God, strikes, epidemics, war, acts of terrorism, riots, flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, sabotage, or other occurrence which is beyond the control of the parties, then we shall be excused from any further performance of obligations and undertakings hereunder, to the full extent allowed under applicable law.
Furthermore, if such an event damages the property to materially affect its habitability by some or all residents, we reserve the right to vacate any and all leases and you agree to excuse us from any further performance of obligations and undertakings hereunder, to the full extent allowed under applicable law.
45.POLITICAL SIGNS. You may post or display political signs relating to an election, legislative vote, initiative, referendum, recall process or issues that are before a public commission, public board or elected local body for a vote as allowed by law. Political signs may be posted in the window or on the door of the dwelling. All political signs must be six square feet or less in size and cannot be posted or displayed in a manner that would violate a local, state or federal law.

46.PAYMENTS. At our option and without notice, we may apply money received (other than sale proceeds under paragraph 13 (Property Left in Dwelling) or utility payments subject to governmental regulations) first to any of your unpaid obligations, then to current rent-regardless of notations on checks or money orders and regardless of when the obligations arose. All sums other than rent are due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have to accept the rent or any other payments. We will accept rent payments from a third party, if the third-party signs an acknowledgment stating 1) the third party is not a current tenant of the property and 2) that acceptance does not establish a tenancy.
47. ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP. We represent that either: (1) we or; (2) the management company that represents us, is at the time of signing this Lease Contract or a renewal of this Lease Contract, a member of both the National Apartment Association and any affiliated state and local dwelling (multi-housing) associations for the area where the dwelling is located.
When Moving Out
48.MOVE-OUT NOTICE. Before moving out, either at the end of the lease term, any extension of the lease term, or prior to the end of the lease term, you must give our representative advance written notice of your intention to vacate as required by the paragraph 3 (Lease Term). The advance notice must be at least the number of days of notice required in paragraph 3 (Lease Terms). The move-out date in your notice [check one]: :unselected: must be the last day of the month,
or :selected: may be the exact day designated in your notice. If neither box is checked, the second checkbox applies. If you move out prior to the end of the lease term, your notice does not act as a release of liability for the full term of the Lease Contract. You will still be liable for the entire Lease Contract term if you move out early under paragraph 23 (Release of Resident), except if you are able to terminate your tenancy under the statutory rights explained under paragraphs 11 (Early Move-Out), 23 (Release of Resident), or under other laws providing a right to terminate this Lease Contract. All notices to vacate must be in writing and must provide the date by which you intend to vacate. If the notice does not comply with the time requirements of the Lease Terms paragraph, even if you move by the last date in the lease term, you will be responsible for an additional month's rent. If you fail to vacate by the date set forth in your notice, you will automatically and immediately become a holdover tenant pursuant to state law, and we will have all remedies available under this Lease Contract and state law.
49.MOVE-OUT PROCEDURES. The move-out date can't be changed unless we and you both agree in writing. You won't move out before the lease term or renewal period ends unless all rent for the entire lease term or renewal period is paid in full. Early move-out may result in reletting charges and liability for future rent under paragraphs 11 (Early Move-Out) and 32 (Default by Resident). You're prohibited by law from applying any security deposit to rent. You won't stay beyond the date you are supposed to move out. You must give us and the U.S. Postal Service, in writing, each resident's forwarding address.
50.CLEANING. You must thoroughly clean the dwelling, including doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been provided. If you don't clean adequately, you'll be liable for reasonable cleaning charges.
51. MOVE-OUT INSPECTION. You should meet with our representative for a move-out inspection. Our representative has no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by us or our representative are subject to our correction, modification, or disapproval before final refunding or accounting.
52.SECURITY DEPOSIT DEDUCTIONS AND OTHER CHARGES.
Lucas Plock You may not use the security deposit to pay any month's rent. We may withhold from the security deposit only such amounts as are reasonably necessary to remedy your defaults including, but not

limited to, the following:
a) Defaults in the payment of rent;
b) To repair damage to the premises caused by you, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear, and/or:
c) To clean the premises, if necessary, upon termination of the tenancy in order to return the unit to the same level of cleanliness it was in at the inception of the tenancy, and /or;
d) To restore, replace, or return personal property or appurtenances, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear.
53.DEPOSIT RETURN, SURRENDER, AND ABANDONMENT.
You are required to provide us written notice of your forwarding address, on or before termination of this Lease Contract. We'll mail you, to the forwarding address you provide, your security deposit refund (less lawful deductions) and an itemized accounting of any deductions within 21 days after surrender or abandonment, unless statutes provide otherwise. If you fail to provide us with your forwarding address in writing, as required above, we will process the unclaimed security deposit in accordance with state law.
Surrender. You have surrendered the dwelling when: (1) the move-out date has passed and no one is living in the dwelling in our reasonable judgment; (2) all dwelling keys and access devices listed in paragraph 5 (Keys) have been turned in where rent is paid- whichever date occurs first, or (3) we reasonably believe that you have surrendered the dwelling to us.
Abandonment. You have abandoned the dwelling when we reasonably believe you have abandoned it. California law provides that abandonment will be found when all of the following have occurred: (1) your rent has been due and unpaid for at least 14 days; (2) we give you written notice of such belief and our intent to terminate the lease because of your delinquency; (3) our notice of abandonment follows substantially the form in California Code Section 1951.3(d); (4) such notice is given by (i) personal delivery to you, or (ii) first class mail, postage prepaid to your last known address; (5) the lease termination date in that notice is at least 15 days after personal delivery or 18 days after mailing; and (6) such 15 or 18 day notice period has expired without response from you as per California Code Section 1951.3. If we have reason to believe you won't receive the notice at your last known address, we will, at the same time we mail the above notice to your last known address, mail a copy to any other addresses that are known to us where you could reasonably be expected to receive the notice.
Surrender, abandonment, and judicial eviction end your right of possession for all purposes and gives us the immediate right to: clean up, make repairs in, and relet the dwelling; determine any security deposit deductions; and remove property left in the dwelling. Surrender, abandonment, and judicial eviction affect your rights to property left in the dwelling (paragraph 13 (Property Left In Dwelling)), but do not affect our mitigation obligations (paragraph 32 (Default by Resident)).'.",Lucas Plock

"Please extract the name of the tenant from the following text: 'Other disposition or Sale. If all the property being stored is believed by us to be worth less than $700 and it has not been redeemed, we may keep, throw away, or give away the property after the 18th day following the giving of the ""Notice of Right to Reclaim Abandoned Property"" above. If all of the property is believed by us to be worth $700 or more, we may (1) release the personal property described in the notice to the former tenant and shall not require the former tenant to pay the cost of storage if the property remained in the dwelling and the former tenant or other person reasonably believed by the landlord to be its owner reclaims the property within two days of vacating the dwelling, (2) we release the property to the person believed by us to be the owner, if all storage charges (and actual advertising/sale expenses) are paid in full after 2 days of storage, or (3) sell the property at public sale in compliance with the procedures of Section 1988 of the California Civil Code. Sale may be subject to any third-party ownership or lien claims, must be to the highest cash bidder, and may be in bulk, in batches, or item-by-item. You and the landlord may bid at the sale. Excess sums will be paid over to the county in accordance with statute.
State law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the tenant, subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general, these costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out.
14. FAILING TO PAY FIRST MONTH'S RENT. If you don't pay the first month's rent when or before the Lease Contract begins, we may end your right of occupancy and recover damages, including future rents (less any mitigation), reletting charges, attorney's fees (consistent with paragraph 32 (Default by Resident)), court costs, and other lawful charges. Our rights and remedies under paragraphs 11 (Early Move-Out) and 32 (Default by Resident) apply to the failure to pay first month's rent upon execution of the Lease Contract.
15.RENT INCREASES AND LEASE CONTRACT CHANGES. No rent increases or Lease Contract changes are allowed before the initial Lease Contract term ends, except for changes allowed by any special provisions in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us, or by reasonable changes of dwelling rules allowed under paragraph 19 (Community Policies or Rules), or as otherwise allowed by law. We will give you a minimum of 30 days notice if you are on a month to month tenancy before we increase the rent (a maximum of 10% increase over the previous 12 months). We will give you at least 90 days notice during a month to month tenancy before we raise the rent more than 10% (over the previous 12 months), unless the increase is caused by a change in your income or family composition as determined by a recertification required by statute or regulation.
16.DELAY OF OCCUPANCY. If occupancy is or will be delayed for construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident's holding over, we're not responsible for the delay. The Lease Contract will remain in force subject to: (1) abatement of rent on a daily basis during delay; and (2) your right to terminate as set forth below. Any termination notice must be in writing. After termination, you are entitled only to refund of deposit(s) and any rent paid. Rent abatement or lease termination does not apply if delay is for cleaning or repairs that don't prevent you from occupying the dwelling.
If there is a delay and we haven't given notice of delay as set forth immediately below, you may terminate up to the date when the dwelling is ready for occupancy, but not later.
(1) If we give written notice to any of you when or after the Lease Contract begins-and the notice states that occupancy has been delayed because of construction or a previous resident's holding over, and that the dwelling will be ready on a specific date-you may terminate the Lease Contract within 3 days of your receiving the notice, but not later.
(2) If we give written notice to any of you before the beginning of the lease term and the notice states that construction delay is expected and that the dwelling will be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease Contract within 7 days after any of you receives written notice, but not later. The readiness date is considered the new beginning date of the lease term for all purposes. This new date may not be moved to an earlier date unless we and you agree.
17. AD VALOREM TAXES/FEES AND CHARGES - ADDITIONAL RENT. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if, during the term of this Agreement, any locality, city, state, or Federal Government imposes upon Us, any fee, charge, or tax, which is related to or charged by the number of occupants, or by the apartment unit itself, such that we are charged a fee, charge, or tax, based upon your use or occupancy of the apartment, we may add this charge as Additional Rent, during the term of the Lease Contract, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to you. After this written notice (the amount or approximate amount of the charge, will be included), you agree to pay, as Additional Rent, the amount of the charge, tax or fee imposed upon us, as a result of your occupancy. As examples, these charges can include, but are not limited to: any charges we receive for any zoning violation, sound, noise or litter charge; any charge under any nuisance or chronic nuisance type statute, 911 or other life safety, per person, or per unit charge or tax and any utility bill unpaid by you, which is then assessed to us for payment.
18.DISCLOSURE RIGHTS.

32.DEFAULT BY RESIDENT. You'll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don't pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you or any guest or occupant violates the Community rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether arrest or conviction occurs; (3) you abandon the dwelling; (4) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application; (5) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia under state statute; (6) any illegal drugs or paraphernalia are found in your dwelling; (7) you or any guest or occupant engages in any of the prohibited conduct described in paragraphs 20 (Limitations on Conduct) or 21 (Prohibited Conduct); or (8) you or any occupant, in bad faith, makes an invalid complaint to an official or employee of a utility company or the government. Any of the above defaults shall be a material breach of the Lease and shall be a just cause to evict you from the dwelling.
Eviction. If you default and if we wish to terminate your right of occupancy, we must give you a 3 Court day written notice to cure the default. If the default is incurable (i.e. assigning or subletting or committing waste upon the demised premises, contrary to the conditions or covenants of this Lease, or maintaining, committing, or permitting the maintenance or commission of a nuisance upon the demised premises, or using the premises for an unlawful purpose, or any other incurable default), we may end your right of occupancy by giving you a 3-day notice to vacate. Notice to cure and notice of occupancy termination must be delivered by either: (1) personal delivery to any resident; or (2) personal delivery at the dwelling to any occupant of suitable age and discretion and sending a copy through the regular U.S. mail addressed to the tenant at his or her place of residence; or (3) posting on the outside of the dwelling's front door, accompanied by mailing the notice by regular U.S. mail. Termination of your possession rights or subsequent reletting doesn't release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations.
Holdover. You or any occupant, invitee, or guest must not hold over beyond the date contained in your move-out notice or our notice to vacate (or beyond a different move-out date agreed to by the parties in writing). If a holdover occurs, then: (1) holdover rent is due in advance on a daily basis and may become delinquent without notice or demand; (2) you'll be liable to us for all rent for the full term of the previously signed Lease Contract of a new resident who can't occupy because of holdover (less any mitigation); and (3) at our option, we may extend the lease term-for up to one month from the date of notice of lease extension-by delivering written notice to you or your dwelling while you continue to hold over.
Other Remedies. If your rent is delinquent and we give you 3 days' prior written notice, we may report unpaid amounts to consumer reporting agencies. If you default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to be rental discounts in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), in addition to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal remedies including lease termination, lockout under statute, and the remedy set forth in Civil Code § 1951.2. The prevailing party may recover from a non-prevailing party attorney's fees and any costs of litigation in an amount of no more than $1200. Late charges are liquidated damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead in collecting late rent (but are not for attorney's fees and litigation costs). All unpaid amounts bear 10% interest per year from due date. To the greatest extent allowed by law, you must pay all collection-agency fees if you fail to pay all sums due within 10 days after we mail you a letter demanding payment and stating that collection agency fees will be added if you don't pay all sums by that deadline. If you fail to fulfill your obligations under this Lease, we intend to submit a negative report to a consumer reporting agency. The report will summarize your violations and be a possible reflection on your credit record.
Remedies Cumulative. Any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.
General Clauses

36.NOTICE. Except when notice or demand is required by statute, you waive any notice and demand for performance from us if you default.

41. INDEMNIFICATION. Subject to applicable law, you shall indemnify and hold the owner, its agents and employees, harmless against all claims, expenses, damages, actions, and liabilities of whatever nature, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or relating to injury, loss or damage relating to your, your guest's or occupant's negligence, tenancy and/or your failure to comply with this Lease Contract.

5 Bed Bug Addendum
5.1 GENERAL
If there are any conflicting provisions between this Addendum, the lease agreement or any other agreement between the parties, this Addendum shall control. This addendum is entered into in compliance with A.R.S. § 33-1319, and is intended to govern the rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant as to bed bugs.
5.2 OBLIGATIONS OF LANDLORD
THE LANDLORD SHALL NOT ENTER INTO ANY LEASE AGREEMENT WITH A TENANT FOR A DWELLING UNIT THAT THE LANDLORD KNOWS TO HAVE A CURRENT BEDBUG INFESTATION. When a unit is known to the Landlord to have bedbugs prior to entry of a lease, Landlord agrees to treat the unit for bedbugs. Upon successful remediation as reasonably determined by the Landlord, the landlord may enter into a lease for the unit. In the event that bed bugs are detected in the unit, and reported proper notice is given by the tenant, the Tenant complies with all of the obligations of this addendum, the Landlord agrees to take all reasonable steps necessary to control or destroy the bedbugs, which may include following the recommended protocol as determined by a licensed pest control service. This requirement in no way limits the landlord's right to use staff to remedy the situation, nor does it relieve the Tenant of liability for the costs to re- mediate any infestation, or exacerbation thereof, caused by Tenant's act, omission or negligence.
5.3 OBLIGATIONS OF TENANT
BY SIGNING THIS LEASE, TENANT HEREBY REPRESENTS AND AVOWS TO LANDLORD THAT TENANT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE, AND HAS NOT HAD WITHIN THE PREVIOUS SIX (6) MONTHS, A BED BUG INFESTATION. Tenant agrees not to move any items into a unit that the tenant knows, believes or should know that contains bed bugs. The tenant agrees to take reasonable steps to prevent, control and provide notice of any signs of bed bugs within three days of when the bed bugs should have first been recognized by an occupant. Tenant agrees to routinely inspect for signs of pests, including after Tenant has visited another home or a hotel. Tenant agrees to prepare their unit for treatment and comply with all recommendations and requests from management and pest control exterminator prior to the professional treatment including but not limited to: placing all food in properly sealed containers, cleaning the home and all food preparation areas on a daily basis.
5.4 COMPLIANCE
If bedbugs are discovered in the unit or in a surrounding unit, the tenant agrees to comply with additional steps including but not limited to:
1) Placing all bedding, drapes, and rugs in bags to be transported for laundry or dry cleaning. Washing and drying all machine-washable items in the hottest setting. Dry cleaning any items that are not washable and notify the drycleaner of the issue so that proper steps may be taken to remedy the issue.
2) Removing or destroying all infected mattresses in sealed plastic and away from the common trash disposal area. Discard any other items that can not be treated in the same manner.
3) Emptying all closets and furniture from the area during treatment and not returning any of those items until they have been cleared by the pest control exterminator. Following instructions on how to properly clean or destroy any infected items.
4) Deeply vacuum all areas of the unit including but not limited to closets and furniture. Follow instructions on how to properly discard vacuum contents.
5) Move all of the furniture away from the walls and leave access to closet areas.
6) Dispose of personal property, including but not limited to, furniture, clothing or other items that may be infested by bed bugs and their eggs, if deemed necessary, by a pest control exterminator.
7) Any further directions from the pest control exterminator.
5.5 BREACH OF AGREEMENT
In the event of a breach of this addendum by Tenant, Landlord may invoke its legal remedies including but not limited to, holding the tenant liable for the cost of remediation and seeking possession of the premises upon giving 5 day health and safety notice. Conduct that constitutes such a material health and safety breach includes failure to promptly notify Landlord of evidence of any pest infestation, refusal to permit Landlord to enter to inspect for infestation or to perform eradication treatments, and failure to complete all required pre-treatment and post-treatment activities, including a failure to report ineffective treatment or re-infestations.
The tenant acknowledges that the Owner is not an insurer of tenant's property and is encouraged to have insurance to cover any losses. Furthermore the tenant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Owner and its agents from any claims, including attorney fees, which the tenant may incur as a result of the negligence of the tenant or their guests. Tenant may be liable for failing to comply with this addendum. Owner and its agents shall not be liable to tenant or their guests for any harm as a result of any pest issue other than for the intentional failure to address a pest issue.

4 General Clauses
4.1 SECURITY DEPOSIT POLICY
The Security Deposit is to ensure Tenant(s) compliance with this Rental Agreement. The Security Deposit shall be held, applied and refunded pursuant to law. If any portion of the Security Deposit is retained by Landlord, written notice will be given to Tenant(s) detailing the reason for retention, which shall be provided within the time as allowed by law and only after delivery of possession of the Premises by Tenant(s), and written demand by Tenant(s). The application of any Security Deposit toward Rent, damages, or other charges does not constitute a limit on Landlord' legal rights to all sums due.
TENANT MAY NOT APPLY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT TO THE LAST'S MONTH'S RENT.
Landlord will refund to Tenant(s) all refundable Deposits held upon the following events: (a) Tenant(s) have complied with the terms and conditions of this Rental Agreement including the payment of all sums due for Rent, late fees and damages; (b) a written notice of intent to vacate as provided herein or by law; (c) Tenant(s) make an appointment with Landlord for inspection of the Premises on the move out date; (d) Tenant(s) deliver possession of the Premises to Landlord in as good order and repair and in a clean, habitable, tenable condition as the time the Premises were leased with reasonable wear and tear excepted; (e) Tenant(s) surrenders to Landlord, in person, all keys, openers, permits and property owned by Landlord; and (f) Tenant(s) make written demand for the remaining security deposit. Tenant(s) agree that Landlord may refund said deposit to any or all person(s) named in the Tenant(s) box, Tenant(s) agree Landlord shall have no liability or responsibility for issuing deposits to any particular tenant in full or making a division thereof; Tenant(s), each of them, shall indemnify, and hold harmless, the Landlord from any expenses, claims, or liabilities due to Tenants' deposit apportionment.
4.2 HOLDOVER TENANTS
A holdover tenancy is created if the Tenant(s) fails to deliver possession of the Premises to the Landlord on or before Expiration Date as provided in the Landlord's or Tenant's 60 day notice. A holdover tenant will be assessed the greater of: 1) rent due plus two months rent, or 2) rent due plus twice the Landlord's actual damages.
4.3 LANDLORD'S LIABILITY
Landlord shall not be liable for any injury to any person or to damage to any property unless such harm or damage is due to the specific negligence of Landlord or arises under law. Landlord
recommends that Tenant(s) secure renter's insurance to protect against liability, flood, leaks, property damage or loss. Should Landlord agree to provide Tenant(s) with any service not required by law, Tenant(s) agree to hold Landlord harmless for all liability in connection with said services.
4.4 MOLD INFORMATION AND PREVENTION
It is our goal to maintain a quality living environment for our residents. To help achieve this goal, it is important that we work together to minimize any mold growth within your home. This document contains important information pertaining to the responsibilities of both Landlord and Resident.
(1) PREVENTING MOLD:
. Keep your dwelling clean - particularly the kitchen, the bathroom(s), carpets and floors. Regular vacuuming, mopping and using a household cleaner to clean hard surfaces is important to remove the household dirt and debris that harbor mold or food for mold. Immediately throw away moldy food.
· Remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, walls, ceilings, floors and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Look for leaks in washing machine hoses and discharge lines - especially if the leak is large enough for water to infiltrate nearby walls. Turn on any exhaust fans in the bathroom and kitchen before you start showering or cooking with open pots. When showering, be sure to keep the shower curtain inside the tub or fully close the shower doors. Also, the experts recommend that after taking a shower or bath, you: (1) wipe moisture off the shower walls, shower doors, the bathtub and the bathroom floor; (2) leave the bathroom door open until all moisture on the mirrors and bathroom walls and tile surfaces has dissipated; and (3) hang up your towels and bath mats so they will completely dry out.
· Promptly notify us in writing about any air conditioning or heating problems you discover. Follow our rules, if any, regarding replacement of air filters. Also, it is recommended that you periodically open windows and doors on days when the outdoor weather is dry (i.e., humidity is below 50%) to help humid areas of your dwelling dry out.
· Promptly notify us in writing about any signs of water leaks, water infiltration or mold. We will respond in accordance with state law and this rental agreement to repair or remedy the situation, as necessary.
(2) AVOID MOLD GROWTH: It is important to prevent excessive moisture buildup in your dwelling. Failure to promptly pay attention to leaks and moisture that might accumulate on dwelling surfaces or that might get inside walls or ceilings can encourage mold growth. Prolonged moisture can result from a wide variety of sources, such as:
· Rainwater leaking from roofs, windows, doors and outside walls, as well as flood waters rising above floor level.
· Overflows from showers, bathtubs, toilets, lavatories, sinks, washing machines, dehumidifiers, refrigerator or A/C drip pans or clogged A/C condensation lines.
· Leaks from plumbing lines or fixtures, leaks into walls from bad or missing grouting/caulking around showers, tubs or sinks.
· Washing machine hose leaks, plant watering overflows, pet urine, cooking spills, beverage spills and steam from excessive open-pot cooking.
· Leaks from clothes dryer discharge vents (which can put excessive moisture into the air).
· Insufficient drying of carpets, carpet pads, shower walls and

3.4 ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING
Tenant(s) have no right to sublet or assign their rights under this Agreement. Any sublease or assignment shall be null and void and Tenant's actions shall be a material breach of this Agreement.
3.5 ABANDONMENT

Should the value of the personal property left within the Premises exceed the costs of moving and storage, in Landlord's opinion, Landlord shall be granted a security interest in such personal property as provided in A.R.S. ' 33-1370, and as it may be amended. Abandonment of the Premises, vacating prior to Expiration, or termination of the Rental Agreement for Tenant(s) breach will subject Tenant(s) to liability for two (2) months rent.
3.6 SUBORDINATION OF RENTAL AGREEMENT
This Rental Agreement and Tenant(s)' leasehold interest here under is subordinate, inferior, and subject to any liens and encumbrances now or hereinafter placed on the Premises by the Landlord; all advances made under any such lien or encumbrance; the interest payable on any such liens or encumbrance; and any and all renewals or extensions of such liens and encumbrances.

At Expiration, this Rental Agreement shall automatically create a month-to-month tenancy unless: (a) Landlord has provided Tenant(s) with written notice of intent not to extend this Rental Agreement on a month-to-month basis, which notice must be delivered to Tenant(s) at least sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration; or (b) Tenant(s) have delivered written notice to Landlord of Tenant(s)' intent to vacate the Premises on the Expiration, at least sixty (60) days prior. Failure of Tenant(s) to provide such written notice of intent to vacate shall be deemed an election to continue the Rental Agreement on a month- to-month basis. Tenant(s) acknowledge that Rent may increase at the renewal of the Rental Agreement or at any time during the month-to-month tenancy. Landlord will give Tenant(s) written notice of any such increase at least sixty (60) days prior to its effect. Landlord reserves the right to deny renewal of this Rental Agreement or to extend the Expiration on a month-to-month basis. Terms of the month-to-month tenancy shall be governed by the terms of this Rental Agreement but Landlord may require a new Rental Agreement to be entered. Should a month-to-month tenancy be created, either party may
cancel the tenancy as provided by law, 60 day Notice of termination may not be revoked by the party giving said notice without the written permission of the recipient. Tenant(s) agree that any 60 day termination notice is applicable to all Tenant(s), even if only a portion of the Tenants authorize said notice; Tenant may not terminate the tenancy of a portion of the Tenants by delivering notice applicable only to a portion of Tenants, any such notice shall terminate the Tenancy of all. Tenant(s) hereby waive any and all ownership interest and title in all personal property left on the Premises after vacating.

For a pet to be approved a separate agreement must be signed and a deposit will be required.

We may do so regardless of notations on checks or money orders and regardless of when the obligations arose. All sums other than Rent and late fees are due upon our demand. After the due date, we do not have to accept any payments.
3.3. Late Fees. If we don't receive your monthly base rent in full when it's due, you must pay late fees as outlined in Lease Details.

'If your electricity is interrupted, you must use only battery- operated lighting (no flames). You must not allow any utilities (other than cable or Internet) to be cut off or switched for any reason-including disconnection for not paying your bills-until the Lease term or renewal period ends. If a utility is individually metered, it must be connected in your name and you must notify the provider of your move- out date. If you delay getting service turned on in your name by the Lease's start date or cause it to be transferred back into our name before you surrender or abandon the apartment, you'll be liable for the charge listed above (not to exceed $50 per billing period), plus the actual or estimated cost of the utilities used while the utility should have been billed to you. If your apartment is individually metered and you change your retail electric provider, you must give us written notice, You must pay all applicable provider fees, including any fees to change service back into our name after you move out.
3.6. Lease Changes. Lease changes are only allowed during the Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specified in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us.

Your new Lease, which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current Lease term or renewal period.
4. Automatic Lease Renewal and Notice of Termination. This Lease will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives written notice of termination or intent to move out as required by Par. 25 and specified on page 1. If the number of days isn't filled in, no- tice of at least 30 days is required.
5. Security Deposit. The total security deposit for all residents is due on or before the date this Lease is signed. Any animal deposit will be designated in an animal addendum. Security deposits may not be ap- plied to Rent without our prior written consent.
5.1. Refunds and Deductions. You must give us your advance notice of move out as provided by Par. 25 and forwarding address in writing to receive a written description and itemized list of charges or refund, In accordance with our Community Policies and as allowed by law, we may deduct from your security deposit any amounts due under the Lease. If you move out early or in response to a notice to vacate, you'll be liable for rekeying charges. Upon receipt of your move-out date and forwarding address in writing, the security deposit will be returned (less lawful deductions) with an itemized accounting of any deductions, no later than 30 days after surrender or abandonment, unless laws provide otherwise. Any refund may be by one payment jointly payable to all residents and distributed to any one resident we choose, or distributed equally among all residents.
6. Insurance. Our insurance doesn't cover the loss of or damage to your personal property. You will be required to have liability insur- ance as specified in our Community Policies or Lease addenda un- less otherwise prohibited by law. If you have insurance covering the apartment or your personal belongings at the time you or we suffer or allege a loss, you agree to require your insurance carrier to waive any insurance subrogation rights. Even if not required, we urge you to obtain your own insurance for losses due to theft, fire, flood, water, pipe leaks and similar occurrences. Most renter's insurance policies don't cover losses due to a flood.
7. Reletting and Early Lease Termination. This Lease may not be ter- minated early except as provided in this Lease.
7.1. Reletting Charge. You'll be liable for a reletting charge as listed in Lease Details, (not to exceed 85% of the highest monthly Rent during the Lease term) if you: (A) fail to move in, or fail to give written move-out notice as required in Par. 25; (B) move out without paying Rent in full for the entire Lease term or renewal period; (C) move out at our demand because of your default; or (D) are judicially evicted. The reletting charge is not a termination, cancellation or buyout fee and does not release you from your obligations under this Lease, including liability for future or past-due Rent, charges for damages or other sums due.
The reletting charge is a liquidated amount covering only part of our damages-for our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing a replacement resident. These damages are uncertain and hard to ascertain-particularly those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising, showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking pros- pects, overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees. You agree that the reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of our damages and that the charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed.
7.2. Early Lease Termination Procedures. In addition to your termination rights referred to in 7.3 or 8.1 below, if this provision applies under Lease Details, you may terminate the Lease prior to the end of the Lease term if all of the following occur: (a) as outlined in Lease Details, you give us written notice of early termination, pay the early termination fee and specify the date by which you'll move out; (b) you are not in default at any time and do not hold over; and (c) you repay all rent concessions, credits or discounts you received during the Lease term. If you are in default, the Lease remedies apply.
7.3. Special Termination Rights. You may have the right under Texas law to terminate the Lease early in certain situations involving military deployment or transfer, family violence, certain sexual offenses, stalking or death of a sole resident.
8. Delay of Occupancy. We are not responsible for any delay of your occupancy caused by construction, repairs, cleaning, or a previous resident's holding over. This Lease will remain in force subject to (1) abatement of Rent on a daily basis during delay, and (2) your right to terminate the Lease in writing as set forth below. Rent abatement and Lease termination do not apply if the delay is for cleaning or re- pairs that don't prevent you from moving into the apartment.
8.1. Termination. If we give written notice to you of a delay in occupancy when or after the Lease begins, you may termi- nate the Lease within 3 days after you receive written notice. If we give you written notice before the date the Lease begins and the notice states that a construction or other delay is expected and that the apartment will be ready for you to occupy on a specific date, you may terminate the Lease within 7 days after receiving written notice.
After proper termination, you are entitled only to refund of any deposit(s) and any Rent you paid.

Our representatives have no authority to bind or limit us regarding deductions for repairs, damages, or charges. Any statements or estimates by us or our representative are subject to our correction, modi- fication, or disapproval before final accounting or refunding.

An apartment is also considered abandoned 10 days after the death of a sole resident.
27.1. The Ending of Your Rights. Surrender, abandonment, or judicial eviction ends your right of possession for all purposes and gives us the immediate right to clean up, make repairs in, and relet the apartment; determine any security-deposit deductions; and remove or store property left in the apartment.
27.2. Removal and Storage of Property. We, or law officers, may- but have no duty to-remove or store all property that in our sole judgment belongs to you and remains in the apartment or in common areas (including any vehicles you or any occupant or guest owns or uses) after you're judicially evicted or if you surrender or abandon the apartment.
We're not liable for casualty, loss, damage, or theft. You must pay reasonable charges for our packing, removing and storing any property.

(1) left in the apartment after surrender or abandonment; or
(2) left outside more than 1 hour after writ of possession is executed, following judicial eviction.
An animal removed after surrender, abandonment, or eviction may be kenneled or turned over to a local authority, humane society, or rescue organization.

In the event Lessor elects to treat such holding over as a renewal of this Lease, each and all of the terms of this lease shall be and remain in full force and effect for the renewal term. (B) In the event no renewal is desired, or if it is refused by Lessor, Lessor shall proceed to let the premises to another and charge Resident for any damages resulting from his failure to deliver possession on the date of termination, in addition to any other rights accruing to Lessor hereunder.

after the Termination Date, you must vacate the Residence by the Termination Date (unless you and Landlord agree in writing to extend the term).
If the Variable Lease Term section is checked to indicate an automatic continuance of the Agreement on a month-to-month basis after the Termination Date, the Agreement will continue after the Termination Date at the Monthly Base Rent amount specified in the Variable Lease Term section, plus a month-to-month rent of N/A, until either party terminates the Agreement by giving the other party at lease thirty (30) days written notice, or as otherwise specified by law. If you have been in possession of the Residence for one year or longer and the tenancy is month-to-month, we will serve a sixty day notice of termination, if required by law.
D. PAYMENTS:
4. RENT. You must pay us the Base Rent amount specified in the Variable Lease Term section. Certain additional amounts due to us are also specified in the Variable Lease Term section. All additional amounts due under this Agreement will be deemed Additional Rent. Collectively, Base Rent and Additional Rent are referred to as ""Rent"". We reserve our right under Civil Code §1479 to apply any payments we receive to any amounts due (whether Rent, late fees or any other Additional Rent amount) in any manner we choose. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all amounts are payable in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, without demand, set-off or deduction. The daily value of the Residence will qbe calculated based on a 30-day month.
5. PAYMENT DETAIL.

Any payments made by mail or placed in a drop box are made at your risk and must be received by us by the due date. You will incur a $25.00 charge for the first dishonored check and $25.00 for any subsequent dishonored check. After receiving any dishonored check, we reserve the right to require all further payments from you to be made by money order, certified check or cashier's check.
We may, but are not required, to accept payments electronically or by credit card, either directly or through a third party payment service system. If you are interested in these payment methods, request information about our current electronic and credit card payment acceptance policy from the management office. We reserve the right at any time to change our electronic and credit card payment policies and/or procedures, the third party payment service system and/or to cease accepting electronic or credit card payments. It is your responsibility before any payment is due to verify whether we are currently accepting payments electronically or by credit card, the proper procedure, and to arrange with us or any third party payment service system to pay electronically or by credit card. A third party payment service system may charge a fee for this service to you and will have specific requirements and procedures you must follow. If any electronic or credit card payment to us or the third party payment service system is reversed or results in a ""charge back,"" you will be responsible for late fees and any additional cost to us or the payment service system, and we will retain all rights and remedies, including the right to terminate your tenancy.
If you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment, and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution.
Use of drop boxes is at your risk. You can reduce the risk of theft of your payment by using electronic payment methods (if we accept electronic payments), or by mailing or personally delivering payments as directed. All checks and money orders must be made payable as specified on the first page of this Agreement. Do not leave the name of the payee blank on checks or money orders; you will not receive a payment credit if the check or money order is stolen and cashed by another party.

Unless required by law, we will not hold the Security Deposit in trust, deposit it in a segregated account, invest it in an interest-bearing account, nor pay you any interest on the Security Deposit. If you do not comply with all of your rental obligations, we may use the Security Deposit to:
. Compensate us for your payment default; or breach of any other obligation under this Agreement, including the cost of recovering possession of the Residence, rental commissions, advertising expenses and other costs incurred because of your breach of the Agreement and the Rent and other amounts due through the end of the Agreement term, (including Rent due up through the date you vacate the Residence, Rent due through the date of judgment, and Rent due after the date of judgment through the end of the original Agreement term) and any other amount necessary to compensate us for your breach of the Agreement, minus amounts we reasonably could have avoided;
Clean the Residence at the termination of the tenancy, if not returned to us at the same level of cleanliness as received;
· Remedy future defaults by you in any obligation to restore, replace or return personal property or appurtenances, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear; or
. Repair damages to the Residence and Property, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear, caused by you or your Related Parties. Damage or deterioration of the Residence is not ordinary wear and tear if it could have been prevented by good maintenance practices by you, or if you failed to notify us of a maintenance issue in a timely fashion in writing so that we could prevent the damage or deterioration.
You may not use the Security Deposit in lieu of last month's Rent or other amounts due under this Agreement. If we apply any portion of your Security Deposit to amounts due during the term of this Agreement, you must replenish the full amount applied within three days of our demand.
If we know you intend to vacate the Residence, we will give you written notice of your right to a pre-move out inspection as required by
