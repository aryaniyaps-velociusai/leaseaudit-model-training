Said deposit shall also be subject to the terms and conditions of any executed Security Deposit Policy. Deposit is neither an advance rental payment nor a bonus to the Lessor. Upon termination of the rental relationship, Lessor shall refund said deposit, as well as an itemized statement of amounts withheld, by mail to the forwarding address left by Resident within sixty (60) days, after the apartment has been vacated by Resident and inspected by Lessor as provided by State statute.

Consideration for this right of cancellation is forfeiture of all deposits even if there has been no damage by Resident. It is further understood that release may be obtained only if all provisions of the lease contract have been complied with. This is only for job listed on application on file at manager's office. If employment changes, it is Resident's responsibility to update application in manager's office. This does not release Resident from cleaning and damage charges.\n",

      "13.10Animal Waste. Unless we have designated a particular area in your dwelling unit or on the grounds for animal defecation and urination, you are prohibited from letting an animal defecate or urinate anywhere on our property and you must take the ani- mal off our property for that purpose. If we allow animal defeca- tion inside the unit, you must ensure that it's done in a litter box with a kitty-litter-type mix. If the animal defecates anywhere on our property (including in a fenced yard for your exclusive use), you must immediately remove the waste and repair any damage. In addition to the terms of this addendum, you must comply with all local ordinances regarding animal defecation.\n",

You understand and agree that the approval of the animal to live in your apartment is expressly conditioned upon all of the forgoing being true and if you have made any misrepresentation it is a violation of the Lease.\n",
