Landlord and Resident agree that the actual cost to Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company when Resident fails to pay the utility bill on time is difficult or impossible to ascertain, but the parties agree that Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company will incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, additional charges, costs in printing and mailing late notices, and lost opportunity costs of the payment. Accordingly, Landlord and Resident agree that if the utility payment is not paid by the due date and/ or resident fails to transition utility to Resident&#x27;s name as utility customer of record when required, then Resident will incur a utility late fee and/ or utility transfer penalty fee of $25.00.

Unless we agree otherwise in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve.

       "32.DEFAULT BY RESIDENT. You&#x27;ll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don&#x27;t pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you move out before your lease expires without paying rent through the end of the lease term or renewal period; (3) you fail to give written move-out notice as required by Paragraph 23 (Military Personnel Clause) or 44 (Move- Out Notice); (4) you or any guest or occupant violates the apartment rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (5) you abandon the apartment; (6) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application; (7) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia, or illegal sexual activity; (8) any illegal drugs, illegal weapons, or drug paraphernalia are found in your apartment; or (9) you or any guest or occupant engages in any of the prohibited conduct described in Paragraph 20 (Prohibited Conduct). If you or any other residents or occupants, on one or more occasions, uses or permits the use of the apartment or leased premises for the commission of a felony or class A misdemeanor under the laws of this state, we shall have the right to void the lease and recover the apartment. We will mitigate our damages to the extent required by Illinois law.\n",
       "Lease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred. In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a default under this Lease, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said subsequent Lease.\n",
       "Notice and Eviction. If you default due to non-payment of rent, we may end your right of occupancy by giving you a five-day written notice to vacate, or similar notice as required by local ordinance, where applicable. If you default by breaching the lease for reasons other than non-payment of rent, we may end your right of occupancy by giving you ten days&#x27; written notice to vacate or similar notice as required by local ordinance, where applicable.\n",

Termination of your possession rights or subsequent reletting doesn&#x27;t release you from liability for future rent or other Lease Contract obligations. After giving notice to vacate or after filing an eviction lawsuit, we may still accept rent or other sums due; the filing or acceptance doesn&#x27;t waive or diminish our right of eviction, or any other contractual or statutory right. Accepting money at any time doesn&#x27;t waive our right to damages, or past or future rent or other sums.\n",
       "Acceleration. All monthly rent for the rest of the Lease Contract term or renewal period will be accelerated automatically without notice or demand (before or after acceleration) and will be immediately due and delinquent if, without our written consent: (1) you move out, remove property in preparing to move out, or give oral or written notice (by you or any occupant) of intent to move out before the Lease Contract term or renewal period ends; and (2) you&#x27;ve not paid all rent for the entire Lease Contract term or renewal period. Such conduct is considered a default for which we need not give you notice. Remaining rent also will be accelerated if you&#x27;re judicially evicted or move out when we demand because you&#x27;ve defaulted. Acceleration is subject to our mitigation obligations to the extent required by Illinois law.\n",
       "Holdover. You or any occupant, invitee, or guest must not hold over beyond the date contained in your move-out notice or our notice to vacate (or beyond a different move-out date agreed to by the parties in writing). If a holdover occurs, then: (1) holdover rent of $ per day is due in advance and may become delinquent without notice or demand; (2) rent for the holdover period will be increased by 25% over the then-existing rent, without notice; (3) you&#x27;ll be liable to us for all rent for the full term of the previously signed Lease Contract of a new resident who can&#x27;t occupy because of the holdover; and (4) if you fail to vacate the apartment, and we accept subsequent rent, you will become a month to month tenant.\n",
       "Remedies Cumulative. Any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.\n",
       "Other Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit agencies. If you default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to be rental discounts in paragraph 11, in addition to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal remedies, including tenancy termination. Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, or personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the non-prevailing party attorney&#x27;s fees and all other litigation costs to the extent permitted by state law or local ordinance. All unpaid amounts bear 9% interest per year from due date, compounded annually. You must pay all collection-agency fees if you fail to pay all sums due within 10 days after we mail you a letter demanding payment and stating that collection agency fees will be added if you don&#x27;t pay all sums by that deadline.\n",

       "4.4 MOLD INFORMATION AND PREVENTION\n",
       "It is our goal to maintain a quality living environment for our residents. To help achieve this goal, it is important that we work together to minimize any mold growth within your home. This document contains important information pertaining to the responsibilities of both Landlord and Resident.\n",
       "(1) PREVENTING MOLD:\n",
       ". Keep your dwelling clean - particularly the kitchen, the bathroom(s), carpets and floors. Regular vacuuming, mopping and using a household cleaner to clean hard surfaces is important to remove the household dirt and debris that harbor mold or food for mold. Immediately throw away moldy food.\n",
       "Â· Remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, walls, ceilings, floors and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Look for leaks in washing machine hoses and discharge lines - especially if the leak is large enough for water to infiltrate nearby walls. Turn on any exhaust fans in the bathroom and kitchen before you start showering or cooking with open pots. When showering, be sure to keep the shower curtain inside the tub or fully close the shower doors. Also, the experts recommend that after taking a shower or bath, you: (1) wipe moisture off the shower walls, shower doors, the bathtub and the bathroom floor; (2) leave the bathroom door open until all moisture on the mirrors and bathroom walls and tile surfaces has dissipated; and (3) hang up your towels and bath mats so they will completely dry out.\n",
       "Â· Promptly notify us in writing about any air conditioning or heating problems you discover. Follow our rules, if any, regarding replacement of air filters. Also, it is recommended that you periodically open windows and doors on days when the outdoor weather is dry (i.e., humidity is below 50%) to help humid areas of your dwelling dry out.\n",
       "Â· Promptly notify us in writing about any signs of water leaks, water infiltration or mold. We will respond in accordance with state law and this rental agreement to repair or remedy the situation, as necessary.\n",
       "(2) AVOID MOLD GROWTH: It is important to prevent excessive moisture buildup in your dwelling. Failure to promptly pay attention to leaks and moisture that might accumulate on dwelling surfaces or that might get inside walls or ceilings can encourage mold growth. Prolonged moisture can result from a wide variety of sources, such as:\n",
       "Â· Rainwater leaking from roofs, windows, doors and outside walls, as well as flood waters rising above floor level.\n",
       "Â· Overflows from showers, bathtubs, toilets, lavatories, sinks, washing machines, dehumidifiers, refrigerator or A/C drip pans or clogged A/C condensation lines.\n",
       "Â· Leaks from plumbing lines or fixtures, leaks into walls from bad or missing grouting/caulking around showers, tubs or sinks.\n",
       "Â· Washing machine hose leaks, plant watering overflows, pet urine, cooking spills, beverage spills and steam from excessive open-pot cooking.\n",
       "Â· Leaks from clothes dryer discharge vents (which can put excessive moisture into the air).\n",
       "Â· Insufficient drying of carpets, carpet pads, shower walls and\n",

Resident waives any insurance subrogation rights or claims against Landlord or Landlord&#x27;s agents, and their insurers. No employee, Landlord, or management company is personally liable for any of Landlord&#x27;s contractual, statutory, or other obligations merely by virtue of acting on behalf of Landlord.

If Resident or any guest or occupant is present, then Resident shall allow repairers, servicers, or Landlord&#x27;s representatives to peacefully enter the Premises at reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below. If nobody is in the Premises, then repairers, servicers, or Landlord&#x27;s representatives may enter peacefully and at reasonable times by duplicate or master key (or by breaking a window or other means if locks have been changed in violation of this Lease Contract) if: (1) written notice of the entry is left in a conspicuous place in the Premises immediately after the entry; and (2) entry is for: any reasonable business purpose including, responding to Resident&#x27;s request; repairs; estimating repair or refurbishing costs; pest control; preventative maintenance; filter changes; testing or replacing detector batteries; retrieving tools or appliances; preventing waste of utilities; delivering, installing, reconnecting, or replacing appliances, furniture, equipment, or security devices; removing or rekeying unauthorized security devices; stopping excessive noise or other disturbances; removing health or safety hazards (including hazardous materials); retrieving property owned or leased by former residents; inspections; entry by a law-enforcement officer with or without a search or arrest warrant or in hot pursuit; showing the Premises to prospective Residents (after move-out or vacate notice has been given); or showing the Premises to government inspectors, fire marshals, lenders, appraisers, prospective buyers, or insurance agents.)\n",

Resident&#x27;s bringing into or onto the Premises or the keeping or possession of any animal for any duration without Landlord&#x27;s written consent shall constitute a violation of this Lease and Resident shall, along with any and all other consequences and penalties outlined in the Lease Documents, be assessed a one-time Pet fee per animal, a pet deposit per animal and monthly pet fees.

These steps may include, but are not limited to, purchasing and using a smokeless ashtray and/or air filtration device, reducing the amount of smoking, ceasing any smoking on decks, patios or other outdoor areas, closing doors and windows. Failure of Resident to take such reasonable steps after a written request from Landlord will be a violation of these Rules &amp; Regulations.\n",

Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all amounts are payable in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, without demand, setoff or deduction. The daily value of the Residence will be calculated based on a 30-day month.\n",

       "Payment instructions (including forms of payment accepted, to whom payments are to be made, and the address where payments are to be made), are specified in the Variable Lease Term section. Any payments made by mail or placed in a drop box are made at your risk and must be received by us by the due date. You will incur a $25.00 charge for the first dishonored check and $35.00 for any subsequent dishonored check. After receiving any dishonored payment (whether under this Agreement or any other), we reserve the right to require all further payments made by you or on your behalf to be made by money order, certified check or cashier&#x27;s check. If a third party tenders a payment on your behalf, we reserve the right to require an acknowledgment from the third party as specified in Civil Code Â§1947.3(a)(3).\n",

If you are interested in these payment methods, request information about our current electronic and credit card payment acceptance policy from the management office. We reserve the right at any time to change our electronic and credit card payment policies and/ or procedures, the third party payment service system and/ or to cease accepting electronic or credit card payments. It is your responsibility before any payment is due to verify whether we are currently accepting payments electronically or by credit card, the proper procedure, and to arrange with us or any third party payment service system to pay electronically or by credit card. A third party payment service system may charge a fee for this service to you and will have specific requirements and procedures you must follow. If any electronic or credit card payment to us or the third party payment service system, or if any payment tendered on your behalf by a third party, is reversed, not honored, or results in a &quot;charge back,&quot; you will be responsible for Late Charges and any additional cost to us or the payment service system, and we will retain all rights and remedies, including the right to terminate your tenancy.\n",

When we use information from the check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from the account as soon as the same day we receive the payment, and you will not receive the check back from your financial institution.\n",
       "Use of drop boxes is at your risk. You can reduce the risk of theft of your payment by using electronic payment methods (if we accept electronic payments), or by mailing or personally delivering payments as directed. All checks and money orders must be made payable as specified on the first page of this Agreement. Do not leave the name of the payee blank on checks or money orders; you will not receive a payment credit if the check or money order is stolen and cashed by another party.\n",

We&#x27;re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We&#x27;re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law-enforcement agency. You also must notify us and furnish us with the law-enforcement agency&#x27;s incident report number upon request.\n",
       "25. CONDITION OF THE PREMISES AND ALTERATIONS. You accept the apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for conditions materially affecting the health or safety of ordinary persons.

Otherwise, everything will be considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working condition.\n",
       "You must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment and not damaging or littering the common areas. Unless authorized by statute (or Ordinance), or by us in writing, you must not make any alterations to the premises, nor perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, or electrical changes, nor install any appliances, locks or other equipment of any kind, or otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are allowed inside or outside the apartment. We will permit a reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of wood- paneled walls, unless our rules state otherwise. No water furniture, washing machines, additional phone or TV-cable outlets, alarm systems, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless statutorily allowed or we&#x27;ve consented in writing. You may install a satellite dish or antenna provided you sign our satellite dish or antenna lease addendum which complies with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You agree not to alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, radon detectors, furniture, telephone and cable TV wiring, screens, locks, and access control devices. When you move in, we&#x27;ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish, including exterior fixtures operated from inside the apartment; after that, you&#x27;ll replace them at your expense with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements to the apartment (whether or not we consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.\n",
       "26.REQUESTS, REPAIRS, AND MALFUNCTIONS. IF YOU OR ANY OCCUPANT NEEDS TO SEND A NOTICE OR REQUEST-FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REPAIRS, INSTALLATIONS, SERVICES, OR SECURITY-RELATED MATTERS-IT MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH EITHER THE ONLINE TENANT/MAINTENANCE PORTAL, OR SIGNED AND IN WRITING AND DELIVERED TO OUR DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE (except in case of fire, smoke, gas, explosion, overflowing sewage, uncontrollable running water, electrical shorts, or crime in progress as described in Paragraph 24 - Resident Safety and Property Loss). Our written notes on your oral request do not constitute a written request from you.\n",
       "Our complying with or responding to any oral request regarding security or non-security matters doesn&#x27;t waive the strict requirement for written notices under this Lease Contract. You must promptly notify us in writing of: water leaks; electrical problems; malfunctioning lights; broken or missing locks or latches; and other conditions that pose a hazard to property, health, or safety. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the apartment if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to avoid property damage or to perform work. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. Air conditioning problems are not emergencies. If air conditioning or other equipment malfunctions, you must notify our representative as soon as possible on a business day. We&#x27;ll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections, taking into consideration when casualty insurance proceeds are received. Rent will not abate in whole or in part unless authorized under Illinois law (or local Ordinance).\n",
       "If we believe that fire or catastrophic damage is substantial, or that performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, we may terminate your tenancy within a reasonable time by giving you written notice. If your tenancy is so terminated, we&#x27;ll refund prorated rent and all deposits, less lawful deductions.\n",
       "27. ANIMALS. Unless otherwise provided under federal, state, or local law, no animals (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community unless we&#x27;ve so authorized in writing. You must remove an illegal or unauthorized animal within 24 hours of notice from us, or you will be considered in default of this Lease Contract. If we allow an animal as a pet, you must execute a separate animal addendum which may require additional deposits, rents, fees or other charges. An animal deposit is considered a general security deposit. We will authorize an assistance animal for a disabled person. When allowed by applicable laws, before we authorize an assistance animal, if the disability is not readily apparent, we may require a written statement from a qualified professional verifying the disability-related need for the assistance animal. If we authorize an assistance animal, we may require you to execute a separate animal and/or assistance animal addendum. Animal deposits, additional rents, fees or other charges will not be required for an assistance animal needed due to disability, including an emotional support or service animal, as authorized under federal, state, or local law. You must not feed stray or wild animals.\n",
       "If you or any guest or occupant violates animal restrictions (with or without your knowledge), you&#x27;ll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease Contract. If an animal has been in the apartment at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we&#x27;ll charge you for defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing, if we deem it necessary, and we may withhold these amounts from your security deposit as describe in Paragraph 48 (Security Deposit Interest, Deductions and Other Charges).\n",
       "28. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. Except as prohibited by state law or local ordinance, if you or any guest or occupant is present, then repairers, servicers, contractors, our representatives or other persons listed in (2) below may peacefully enter the apartment at reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below. You will not unreasonably withhold consent for us to enter your apartment at reasonable times for reasonable purposes as provided by statute or local ordinance.

Resident agrees to pay Landlord $20 (Twenty) for each dishonored check in addition to any applicable late fees and actual damages incurred by Landlord. Except for non-payment of rent, Resident is subject to a legal notice posting fee of $75 per occurrence. Upon Demand, Resident must immediately replace any dishonored check with certified funds. If Resident makes any payment in response to an eviction notice or demand for rent or possession, Resident shall make such payments in certified funds and not by any electronic payment method.

If Resident exercises Resident&#x27;s statutory right to pay, Landlord only has to accept Resident&#x27;s payment if Resident fully pays all amounts due according to eviction notice, as well as any rent that remains due under this Agreement.

If Landlord files an eviction case and the court determines the possession issue because Resident disputes the eviction case, attorneys&#x27; fees and costs will be awarded to the prevailing party as determined by the court consistent with the parties&#x27; intent to have attorneys&#x27; fees and court costs awarded to the prevailing party in disputed court actions as set forth in paragraph 33 of this Agreement.\n",

Resident&#x27;s notice to vacate shall specify the date that Resident will vacate (&quot;Vacate Date&quot;) and such date shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date Resident gives notice and shall not be for a date prior to the end of the Lease Term. Landlord is not obligated to give 30 days&#x27; notice. Landlord must give the appropriate notice provided for in the Colorado Revised Statutes, which in some cases is as little as 3 days&#x27; notice. If Resident gives any notice to vacate, the 30-day period commences on the day after Resident gives notice, and Resident shall vacate on or before the last day of the notice period. Regardless of when Resident gives notice, Resident agrees to pay Landlord rent for the entire notice period regardless of whether Resident occupies the Premises for the entire notice period. Resident&#x27;s notice to Landlord shall be effective if executed by any Resident who executed the Lease, regardless of whether any or all other Residents who executed this Lease sign the notice. Resident&#x27;s notice of intent to vacate shall only be effective on the date after the notice is actually received by and receipted for by Landlord. Resident agrees to personally deliver any notice to vacate to Landlord to guarantee the effective date of any notice. If Resident vacates without giving notice as required in this paragraph, Resident shall be liable for and agrees to pay Landlord for 30 days of rent previously or actually paid by Resident covering the 30-days of rent less any amounts of rent previously or actually paid by Resident covering the 30-day notice period. Regardless of the number of days in a month, Resident agrees that notices tendered AFTER the first day of any month shall not be effective to terminate this Lease Contract until the last day of the following month (example: notice received on June 3 will not terminate lease until July 31.). If Resident fails to give the required notice to vacate, Resident agrees that the amounts agreed to be paid by Resident in such event represent a fair amount to allocate the numerous risks and liabilities between Resident and Landlord. Resident shall pay all amounts set forth in this paragraph, in addition to any other amounts owed by Resident under the terms of this Agreement.

We may replace dead or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice to you. Neither you nor others may disable smoke detectors. If you damage or disable the smoke detector or remove a battery without replacing it with a working battery, you may be liable to us for $100 plus one month&#x27;s rent, actual damages, and attorney&#x27;s fees.

We have no duty to remove any ice, sleet, or snow but may remove any amount with or without notice. During freezing weather, you must ensure that the temperature in the apartment is sufficient to make sure that the pipes do not freeze (we suggest at least 50 degrees). If the pipes freeze or any other damage is caused by your failure to properly maintain the heat in your apartment, you&#x27;ll be liable for damage to our and other&#x27;s property. If you ask our representatives to perform services not contemplated in this Lease Contract, you will indemnify us and hold us harmless from all liability for these services.\n",

We&#x27;re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We&#x27;re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community or in the surrounding neighborhood. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law- enforcement agency.

Children under 6 years old are most at risk for lead poisoning in your home.\\nÂ· Lead exposure can harm young children and babies even before they are born.\\nÂ· Homes, schools, and child care facilities built before 1978 are likely to contain lead-based paint.\\n. Even children who seem healthy may have dangerous levels of lead in their bodies.\\nÂ· Disturbing surfaces with lead-based paint or removing lead-based paint improperly can increase the danger to your family.\\n. People can get lead into their bodies by breathing or swallowing lead dust, or by eating soil or paint chips containing lead.\\nÂ· People have many options for reducing lead hazards. Generally, lead-based paint that is in good condition is not a hazard (see page 10). :selected: Blue Moon eSignature Services Document ID: 380993857\\n17\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\nLandlord reserves the right to modify the method used to charge Resident, in Landlord&#x27;s reasonable discretion.\\nSubmetered Utilities: Billings based on submeter readings (if any) will itemize the beginning and ending meter readings, the rate charged to Resident, and all categories of information that appear within the utility&#x27;s standard billing format to the Landlord. If the Premises are submetered, Resident agrees to allow Landlord, or a billing service provider Landlord designates, access to the Premises to install, repair, remove and read submeters. Billing amounts based on submeter reading will be determined by dividing the total master bill according to submeter readings.\\nBoth Flat and Variable Utility Reimbursement is administered by Landlord Billing: Landlord bills utilities to Resident. The payment instructions on Lease Agreement apply to utility billings as well as to any other payments due from Resident to Landlord, except as modified below. The due date for Rent and utility charges may not coincide. Resident&#x27;s failure to pay the utility charges by their due date will be considered a material breach of the Agreement, grounds for termination of the tenancy, and if allowed by law, we may discontinue providing the utilities to you. Utility billings will be prorated as necessary. Each bill will include a monthly service fee of $5.00 to compensate Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company to pay and communicate with utility providers, read the meters and/or submeters, calculate and allocate utility fees, provide billing services, and otherwise address utility issues.\\nUtility Late Fees/Transfer Penalty: Resident must make payment in full to Landlord or the Utility Billing Company of the utility charges before the due date listed on each bill. Landlord and Resident agree that the actual cost to Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company when Resident fails to pay the utility bill on time is difficult or impossible to ascertain, but the parties agree that Landlord and/or the Utility Billing Company will incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, additional charges, costs in printing and mailing late notices, and lost opportunity costs of the payment. Accordingly, Landlord and Resident agree that if the utility payment is not paid by the due date and/ or resident fails to transition utility to Resident&#x27;s name as utility customer of record when required, then Resident will incur a utility late fee and/ or utility transfer penalty fee of $25.00. Resident will also be responsible for reimbursement of utility bill charges received by Landlord for failure to put utilities into Resident&#x27;s name.\\nResident Questions and Concerns Regarding Utility Billings.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\nWhere no emergency exists, if any utility has been turned off due to no fault of us, we shall be permitted to enter the premises. We may then inspect the premises, ascertain any damages and make necessary repairs that have resulted from the lack of utilities.\\nWe also have the right of access by Court Order; if you are deceased, incapacitated, or incarcerated; if you have abandoned or surrendered the premises; or during your extended absence in excess of seven (7)days. We may enter the premises without notice if you fail to repair, replace or clean as promptly as conditions require a breach of lease that materially affects health and safety.\\nWe may also upon twenty-four (24) hours notice enter the premises within thirty (30) days of termination of tenancy for the purpose of showing the subject premises to prospective tenants.\\n30.JOINT AND SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITY. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all lease obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Our requests and notices (including sale notices) to any resident constitute notice to all residents and occupants. Notices and requests from any resident or occupant (including notices of tenancy termination, repair requests, and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. In eviction suits, each resident is considered the agent of all other residents in the dwelling unit for service of process. Security-deposit refunds and deduction itemizations of multiple residents will comply with paragraph 50 (Deposit Return, Surrender, and Abandonment).\\nReplacements\\n31.REPLACEMENTS AND SUBLETTING. Replacing a resident, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or license to occupy, no matter the length of the term, the subject area, or the use of the subject area, is strictly prohibited unless we expressly consent in writing. If departing or remaining residents find a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly consent, in writing, to the replacement, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or any license to occupy, then:\\n(1) a reletting charge will not be due; and\\n(2) a reasonable administrative (paperwork) and/or transfer fee will be due, and a rekeying fee will be due if rekeying is requested or required.\\nProcedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, the departing, remaining, and new residents must properly execute our Lease Contract Amendment to Add or Change a Roommate During Lease Term. The Addendum will not be effective until executed by all departing, remaining, and new residents, as well as Owner or Owner&#x27;s representative.\\nResponsibilities of Owner and Resident\\n32.RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We will act with customary diligence to comply with requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety.\\nNotice of any non-compliance by us must be properly given to us in writing.\\n33. DEFAULT BY RESIDENT. You&#x27;ll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract or statutory obligations including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don&#x27;t pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you or any guest or occupant violates the dwelling unit rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (3) you abandon the dwelling unit; (4) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application, no matter when we discover the false or incorrect statements; (5) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia under state statute (6) any illegal drugs or paraphernalia are found in your dwelling unit; (7) you or any guest or occupant engages in any of the prohibited conduct described in paragraph 21 (Prohibited Conduct); or (8) you or any occupant, in bad faith, makes an invalid complaint to an official or employee of a utility company or the government.\\nEviction-Counties Where Tennessee Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act Applies.\\n(1) With the exception of non-payment of rent, if you fail to pay for the costs of repairs, damages or any other amount due to us pursuant to this Lease Contract, you will receive a written notice specifying the violation and advising you that your tenancy will terminate upon a date not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt of this notice, if the violation is not cured within fourteen (14) days. If the violation is a repeat offense of an earlier violation occurring within six (6) months, for which notice was given, your tenancy will terminate on seven (7) days notice without a right to cure the default. If your breach involves a required repair of physical damages, you shall not proceed with the repair of those damages without our specific written consent. Any repairs made by you without our specific written consent will be additional grounds for termination of your tenancy.\\nNOTICE OF TERMINATION OF TENANCY FOR NON- PAYMENT OF RENT IS HEREBY SPECIFICALLY WAIVED.\\n(2) Your tenancy will terminate three (3) days from the date written notice is delivered to you, if you or any other persons in the dwelling unit, with your consent (a) willfully or intentionally commit a violent act, (b) behave in a manner which constitutes or threatens to be a real and present danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the life or property of other tenants or persons on the premises, (c) create a hazardous or unsanitary condition on the property that affects the health, safety or welfare of the life\\nor property of other tenants or persons on the premises, or (d) refuses to vacate the premises after entering the premises as an unauthorized subtenant or unauthorized occupant.\\n(3) For all other defaults other than non-payment of rent, you may receive notice that your tenancy will terminate upon a date not less than fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the notice.\\nAfter giving notice to vacate or filing an eviction suit, any rental payments tendered are hereby accepted with reservations of all our rights and remedies; this acceptance does not waive or diminish our right of eviction, or any other contractual or statutory right. Accepting money at any time does not waive our right to damages; past or future rent or other sums; or to continue with eviction proceedings.\\nEviction-Counties Where Tennessee&#x27;s Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act Does Not Apply. If (1) you neglect or refuse to pay rent that is due and is in arrears, upon demand, and you have not waived your right to notice of termination of tenancy for non-payment of rent; or, (2) you or members of your household or guests damage the subject premises beyond normal wear and tear, you will receive a written notice specifying the violation and advising you that your tenancy will terminate upon a date not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt of the notice if the violation is not cured within fourteen (14) days. If the violation is a repeat offense of an earlier violation occurring within six (6) months, your tenancy will terminate on fourteen (14) days&#x27; notice without a right to cure the default. When allowed by statute, three (3) days&#x27; notice shall be sufficient to terminate tenancy if you, or any other person on the premises with your consent, willfully or intentionally commits a violent act; engages in any drug-related activity; or behaves in a manner that constitutes or threatens to be a real and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the life or property of other tenants, the landlord, the landlord&#x27;s representatives or other persons on the premises, or if an unauthorized subtenant or unauthorized occupant refuses to vacate the premises.\\nTermination of your possession rights or subsequent reletting does not release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations. After giving notice to vacate or filing an eviction suit, any rental payments tendered are hereby accepted with reservations of all our rights and remedies.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\nequipment, or access control devices; removing unauthorized access control devices; stopping excessive noise; removing health or safety hazards (including hazardous materials); removing perishable foodstuffs if your electricity is disconnected; inspecting when immediate danger to person or property is reasonably suspected; allowing entry by a law officer with a search or arrest warrant, or in hot pursuit; showing apartment to prospective residents (after move-out or vacate notice has been given); or showing the apartment to government inspectors, fire marshals, lenders, appraisers, contractors, prospective buyers, or insurance agents.\\n29. JOINT AND SEVERAL RESPONSIBILITY. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for all Lease Contract obligations. If you or any guest or occupant violates the Lease Contract or rules, all residents are considered to have violated the Lease Contract. Our requests and notices (including sale notices) to any resident constitute notice to all residents and occupants. Notices and requests from any resident or occupant (including notices of termination, repair requests, and entry permissions) constitute notice from all residents. In eviction suits, each resident is considered the agent of all other residents in the apartment for service of process. Security deposit refunds may be by one check jointly payable to all residents; the check and any deduction itemizations may be mailed to one resident only.\\nReplacements\\n30.REPLACEMENTS AND SUBLETTING. Replacing a resident, subletting, assignment, granting a right or license to occupy is allowed only when we expressly consent in writing. To the extent allowed by law, we may charge a subletting fee. If departing or remaining residents find a replacement resident acceptable to us before moving out and we expressly consent, in writing, to the replacement, subletting, assignment, or granting a right or any license to occupy, then:\\n(1) an administrative (paperwork) and/or transfer fee will be due; and\\n(2) you will remain liable for all Lease Contract obligations for the rest of the original Lease Contract term.\\nProcedures for Replacement. If we approve a replacement resident, then, at our option: (1) the replacement resident must sign this Lease Contract with or without an increase in the total security deposit; or (2) the remaining and replacement residents must sign an entirely new Lease Contract. Unless we agree otherwise in writing, your security deposit will automatically transfer to the replacement resident as of the date we approve. The departing resident will no longer have a right to occupancy or to a security deposit refund, but will remain liable for the remainder of the original Lease Contract term unless we agree otherwise in writing-even if a new Lease Contract is signed.\\nResponsibilities of Owner and Resident\\n31.RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We&#x27;ll act with customary diligence to:\\n(1) keep common areas reasonably clean, subject to paragraph 25 (Condition of the Premises and Alterations);\\n(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating and A/C equipment;\\n(3) comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding safety, sanitation, and fair housing; and\\n(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay for damages for which you are liable.\\n32.DEFAULT BY RESIDENT. You&#x27;ll be in default if you or any guest or occupant violates any terms of this Lease Contract including but not limited to the following violations: (1) you don&#x27;t pay rent or other amounts that you owe when due; (2) you move out before your lease expires without paying rent through the end of the lease term or renewal period; (3) you fail to give written move-out notice as required by Paragraph 23 (Military Personnel Clause) or 44 (Move- Out Notice); (4) you or any guest or occupant violates the apartment rules, or fire, safety, health, or criminal laws, regardless of whether or where arrest or conviction occurs; (5) you abandon the apartment; (6) you give incorrect or false answers in a rental application; (7) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia, or illegal sexual activity; (8) any illegal drugs, illegal weapons, or drug paraphernalia are found in your apartment; or (9) you or any guest or occupant engages in any of the prohibited conduct described in Paragraph 20 (Prohibited Conduct). If you or any other residents or occupants, on one or more occasions, uses or permits the use of the apartment or leased premises for the commission of a felony or class A misdemeanor under the laws of this state, we shall have the right to void the lease and recover the apartment. We will mitigate our damages to the extent required by Illinois law.\\nLease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred. In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a default under this Lease, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said subsequent Lease.\\nNotice and Eviction. If you default due to non-payment of rent, we may end your right of occupancy by giving you a five-day written notice to vacate, or similar notice as required by local ordinance, where applicable. If you default by breaching the lease for reasons other than non-payment of rent, we may end your right of occupancy by giving you ten days&#x27; written notice to vacate or similar notice as required by local ordinance, where applicable.\\nNotice may be served by: (1) personal delivery at the apartment to you or any occupant over 13 years old; (2) by certified or registered\\nmail, return receipt requested-the mailing of same shall constitute delivery; or (3) if no one answers the door, by posting a copy of the notice to the door of the apartment. Termination of your possession rights or subsequent reletting doesn&#x27;t release you from liability for future rent or other Lease Contract obligations. After giving notice to vacate or after filing an eviction lawsuit, we may still accept rent or other sums due; the filing or acceptance doesn&#x27;t waive or diminish our right of eviction, or any other contractual or statutory right. Accepting money at any time doesn&#x27;t waive our right to damages, or past or future rent or other sums.\\nAcceleration. All monthly rent for the rest of the Lease Contract term or renewal period will be accelerated automatically without notice or demand (before or after acceleration) and will be immediately due and delinquent if, without our written consent: (1) you move out, remove property in preparing to move out, or give oral or written notice (by you or any occupant) of intent to move out before the Lease Contract term or renewal period ends; and (2) you&#x27;ve not paid all rent for the entire Lease Contract term or renewal period. Such conduct is considered a default for which we need not give you notice. Remaining rent also will be accelerated if you&#x27;re judicially evicted or move out when we demand because you&#x27;ve defaulted. Acceleration is subject to our mitigation obligations to the extent required by Illinois law.\\nHoldover. You or any occupant, invitee, or guest must not hold over beyond the date contained in your move-out notice or our notice to vacate (or beyond a different move-out date agreed to by the parties in writing). If a holdover occurs, then: (1) holdover rent of $ per day is due in advance and may become delinquent without notice or demand; (2) rent for the holdover period will be increased by 25% over the then-existing rent, without notice; (3) you&#x27;ll be liable to us for all rent for the full term of the previously signed Lease Contract of a new resident who can&#x27;t occupy because of the holdover; and (4) if you fail to vacate the apartment, and we accept subsequent rent, you will become a month to month tenant.\\nRemedies Cumulative. Any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.\\nOther Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit agencies. If you default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to be rental discounts in paragraph 11, in addition to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal remedies, including tenancy termination. Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, or personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the non-prevailing party attorney&#x27;s fees and all other litigation costs to the extent permitted by state law or local ordinance. All unpaid amounts bear 9% interest per year from due date, compounded annually. You must pay all collection-agency fees if you fail to pay all sums due within 10 days after we mail you a letter demanding payment and stating that collection agency fees will be added if you don&#x27;t pay all sums by that deadline.\\nPage 5 of 8\\n@ 2022, National Apartment Association, Inc. - /2022 Illinois Blue Moon eSignature Services Document ID: 360312163 :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected:\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if, during the term of this Agreement, any locality, city, state, or Federal Government imposes upon Us, any fee, charge, or tax, which is related to or charged by the number of occupants, or by the Premises itself, such that we are charged a fee, charge, or tax, based upon your use or occupancy of\\nthe Premises, we may add this charge as Additional Rent, during the term of the Lease Contract, with thirty (30) days advance written notice to you. After this written notice (the amount or approximate amount of the charge, will be included), you agree to pay, as Additional Rent, the amount of the charge, tax or fee imposed upon us, as a result of your occupancy. As examples, these charges can include, but are not limited to: any charges we receive for any zoning violation, sound, noise or litter charge; any charge under any nuisance or chronic nuisance type statute, 911 or other life safety, per person, or per unit charge or tax and any utility bill unpaid by you, which is then assessed to us for payment.\\n18.DISCLOSURE RIGHTS.

Jackson AHJ\\nSysairesse Davis\\n4 General Clauses\\n4.1 SECURITY DEPOSIT POLICY\\nThe Security Deposit is to ensure Tenant(s) compliance with this Rental Agreement. The Security Deposit shall be held, applied and refunded pursuant to law. If any portion of the Security Deposit is retained by Landlord, written notice will be given to Tenant(s) detailing the reason for retention, which shall be provided within the time as allowed by law and only after delivery of possession of the Premises by Tenant(s), and written demand by Tenant(s). The application of any Security Deposit toward Rent, damages, or other charges does not constitute a limit on Landlord&#x27; legal rights to all sums due.\\nTENANT MAY NOT APPLY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT TO THE LAST&#x27;S MONTH&#x27;S RENT.\\nLandlord will refund to Tenant(s) all refundable Deposits held upon the following events: (a) Tenant(s) have complied with the terms and conditions of this Rental Agreement including the payment of all sums due for Rent, late fees and damages; (b) a written notice of intent to vacate as provided herein or by law; (c) Tenant(s) make an appointment with Landlord for inspection of the Premises on the move out date; (d) Tenant(s) deliver possession of the Premises to Landlord in as good order and repair and in a clean, habitable, tenable condition as the time the Premises were leased with reasonable wear and tear excepted; (e) Tenant(s) surrenders to Landlord, in person, all keys, openers, permits and property owned by Landlord; and (f) Tenant(s) make written demand for the remaining security deposit. Tenant(s) agree that Landlord may refund said deposit to any or all person(s) named in the Tenant(s) box, Tenant(s) agree Landlord shall have no liability or responsibility for issuing deposits to any particular tenant in full or making a division thereof; Tenant(s), each of them, shall indemnify, and hold harmless, the Landlord from any expenses, claims, or liabilities due to Tenants&#x27; deposit apportionment.\\n4.2 HOLDOVER TENANTS\\nA holdover tenancy is created if the Tenant(s) fails to deliver possession of the Premises to the Landlord on or before Expiration Date as provided in the Landlord&#x27;s or Tenant&#x27;s 60 day notice. A holdover tenant will be assessed the greater of: 1) rent due plus two months rent, or 2) rent due plus twice the Landlord&#x27;s actual damages.\\n4.3 LANDLORD&#x27;S LIABILITY\\nLandlord shall not be liable for any injury to any person or to damage to any property unless such harm or damage is due to the specific negligence of Landlord or arises under law. Landlord\\nrecommends that Tenant(s) secure renter&#x27;s insurance to protect against liability, flood, leaks, property damage or loss. Should Landlord agree to provide Tenant(s) with any service not required by law, Tenant(s) agree to hold Landlord harmless for all liability in connection with said services.\\n4.4 MOLD INFORMATION AND PREVENTION\\nIt is our goal to maintain a quality living environment for our residents. To help achieve this goal, it is important that we work together to minimize any mold growth within your home. This document contains important information pertaining to the responsibilities of both Landlord and Resident.\\n(1) PREVENTING MOLD:\\n. Keep your dwelling clean - particularly the kitchen, the bathroom(s), carpets and floors. Regular vacuuming, mopping and using a household cleaner to clean hard surfaces is important to remove the household dirt and debris that harbor mold or food for mold. Immediately throw away moldy food.\\nÂ· Remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, walls, ceilings, floors and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible. Look for leaks in washing machine hoses and discharge lines - especially if the leak is large enough for water to infiltrate nearby walls. Turn on any exhaust fans in the bathroom and kitchen before you start showering or cooking with open pots. When showering, be sure to keep the shower curtain inside the tub or fully close the shower doors. Also, the experts recommend that after taking a shower or bath, you: (1) wipe moisture off the shower walls, shower doors, the bathtub and the bathroom floor; (2) leave the bathroom door open until all moisture on the mirrors and bathroom walls and tile surfaces has dissipated; and (3) hang up your towels and bath mats so they will completely dry out.\\nÂ· Promptly notify us in writing about any air conditioning or heating problems you discover. Follow our rules, if any, regarding replacement of air filters. Also, it is recommended that you periodically open windows and doors on days when the outdoor weather is dry (i.e., humidity is below 50%) to help humid areas of your dwelling dry out.\\nÂ· Promptly notify us in writing about any signs of water leaks, water infiltration or mold.

Failure to promptly pay attention to leaks and moisture that might accumulate on dwelling surfaces or that might get inside walls or ceilings can encourage mold growth. Prolonged moisture can result from a wide variety of sources, such as:\\nÂ· Rainwater leaking from roofs, windows, doors and outside walls, as well as flood waters rising above floor level.\\nÂ· Overflows from showers, bathtubs, toilets, lavatories, sinks, washing machines, dehumidifiers, refrigerator or A/C drip pans or clogged A/C condensation lines.\\nÂ· Leaks from plumbing lines or fixtures, leaks into walls from bad or missing grouting/caulking around showers, tubs or sinks.\\nÂ· Washing machine hose leaks, plant watering overflows, pet urine, cooking spills, beverage spills and steam from excessive open-pot cooking.\\nÂ· Leaks from clothes dryer discharge vents (which can put excessive moisture into the air).\\nÂ· Insufficient drying of carpets, carpet pads, shower walls and\\n5 :selected: :selected:\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

You and all occupants and guests must exercise due care for your own and others&#x27; safety and security, especially in the use of smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors, keyed deadbolt locks, keyless bolting devices, window latches, and access control devices.\\nSmoke Detectors and Carbon Monoxide Detectors. We&#x27;ll furnish smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors as required by statute, and we&#x27;ll test them and provide working batteries, if applicable, when you first take possession. After that, you must pay for and replace batteries as needed, unless the law provides otherwise. We may replace dead or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice to you. You must periodically inspect the smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors to ensure their operability and immediately report smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector malfunctions to us. Neither you nor others may disable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors.

During freezing weather, you must ensure that the temperature in the apartment is sufficient to make sure that the pipes do not freeze (the appropriate temperature will depend upon weather conditions and the size and layout of your unit). If the pipes freeze or any other damage is caused by your failure to properly maintain the heat in your apartment, you&#x27;ll be liable for damage to our and other&#x27;s property. If you ask our representatives to perform services not contemplated in this Lease Contract, you will indemnify us and hold us harmless from all liability for those services.\\nCrime or Emergency.

You should then contact our representative. Unless otherwise provided by law, we&#x27;re not liable to you or any guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, or other crimes. We&#x27;re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We&#x27;re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law-enforcement agency.

SURRENDER AND ABANDONMENT.\\nSurrender. You have surrendered the apartment when all apartment keys and access devices listed in paragraph 5 (Keys) have been turned in where rent is paid.\\nAbandonment. As set forth in Fla. Stat. s. 83.59(3)(c), in the absence of actual knowledge of abandonment, it shall be presumed that you have abandoned the apartment if you are absent from the apartment for a period of time equal to one-half the time for periodic renta! payments; however, this presumption does not apply if the rent is current or you have notified us, in writing, of an intended absence. Surrender, abandonment, and judicial eviction end your right of possession for all purposes and gives us the immediate right to: clean up, make repairs in, and relet the apartment; determine any security deposit deductions, and remove property left in the apartment. Surrender, abandonment, and judicial eviction affect your rights to property left in the apartment (paragraph 13 (Contractual Lien and Property Left in Apartment)), but do not affect our mitigation obligations (paragraph 33 (Default by Resident)).\\nSeverability, Signatures, Originals and Attachments\\n53.

To the greatest extent permitted by law, Landlord shall not be liable to Resident, even for negligent acts or omissions of Landlord or Landlord&#x27;s representatives, for any damage or injury, whether to person or property, loss, or destruction to Resident&#x27;s property, including but not limited, to any damage or injury, whether to person or property, loss, or destruction of property sustained by Resident from any cause, including but not limited to, the causes and risks set forth herein. To the greatest extent permitted by law, Resident agrees to hold Landlord harmless and to indemnify Landlord against and from any lawsuit, loss, cost, expense, damage, or claim including attorneys&#x27; fees and costs resulting from any injury, whether to property or to person, whether to Resident, Resident&#x27;s family, occupants, guests, invitees, or any person entering the Premises, unless prohibited by law. Resident waives any insurance subrogation rights or claims against Landlord or Landlord&#x27;s agents, and their insurers. No employee, Landlord, or management company is personally liable for any of Landlord&#x27;s contractual, statutory, or other obligations merely by virtue of acting on behalf of Landlord. All provisions regarding Landlord&#x27;s non or no-liability and no-duty apply to Landlord&#x27;s employees, Landlords, and management companies.\\n1.27 LANDLORD&#x27;S ACCESS\\nLandlord shall have the right to enter the Premises, with notice when practical, without notice when not practical, at any reasonable time to examine, inspect, repair, show, or for any other legitimate or necessary purpose which Landlord determines in its sole discretion. If Resident fails to provide entry or safe access to premises to Landlord, then Resident shall be charged $75.00 for related time and travel. If Resident or any guest or occupant is present, then Resident shall allow repairers, servicers, or Landlord&#x27;s representatives to peacefully enter the Premises at reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below. If nobody is in the Premises, then repairers, servicers, or Landlord&#x27;s representatives may enter peacefully and at reasonable times by duplicate or master key (or by breaking a window or other means if locks have been changed in violation of this Lease Contract) if: (1) written notice of the entry is left in a conspicuous place in the Premises immediately after the entry; and (2) entry is for: any reasonable business purpose including, responding to Resident&#x27;s request; repairs; estimating repair or refurbishing costs; pest control; preventative maintenance; filter changes; testing or replacing detector batteries; retrieving tools or appliances; preventing waste of utilities; delivering, installing, reconnecting, or replacing appliances, furniture, equipment, or security devices; removing or rekeying unauthorized security devices; stopping excessive noise or other disturbances; removing health or safety hazards (including hazardous materials); retrieving property owned or leased by former residents; inspections; entry by a law-enforcement officer with or without a search or arrest warrant or in hot pursuit; showing the Premises to prospective Residents (after move-out or vacate notice has been given); or showing the Premises to government inspectors, fire marshals, lenders, appraisers, prospective buyers, or insurance agents.)\\n1.28 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY\\nEach person executing this Lease is fully and personally liable and obligated for promises, covenants, and agreements in this Lease, including but in no way limited to, the promise to pay any and all rent and other amounts. In the event of default, Landlord may enforce his rights under this Lease against each person individually, or against all the persons.\\n1.29 PETS - ANIMALS\\nResident shall not be allowed to have or bring, even temporarily, any animal (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, or insects) anywhere in or on the Premises at any time, except by prior written consent of Landlord. If Landlord agrees to permit Resident to possess an animal (&quot;pet&quot;), both Resident and Landlord must sign a separate pet agreement or addendum and the applicable pet deposit and/or pet fee, as set forth by Landlord, must be tendered to Landlord. Resident&#x27;s bringing into or onto the Premises or the keeping or possession of any animal for any duration without Landlord&#x27;s written consent shall constitute a violation of this Lease and Resident shall, along with any and all other consequences and penalties outlined in the Lease Documents, be assessed a one-time Pet fee per animal, a pet deposit per animal and monthly pet fees. All amounts are due and payable at the time of, and in addition to, the following month&#x27;s rent payment. In any action brought by Landlord to enforce this paragraph, Resident shall bear the burden of proof regarding any pet&#x27;s status or removal.\\n1.30 SMOKING\\nSmoking or vaping in the Premises and on property is not allowed unless in a designated smoking area. If Resident smokes within the Premises, Resident shall be responsible for all resulting costs and damages due to Resident&#x27;s smoking. Resident understands and agrees that any damage caused by or related to cigarette, pipe, cigar, or other smoking shall not constitute ordinary wear and tear. For example, Resident agrees that costs for painting and for removal of smoke odor are not normal wear and tear.\\nResidents and/or guests who smoke are requested to dispose of cigarette butts properly (in trash receptacles), not on property grounds, parking lot areas, planters&#x27; pots, etc. If your smoking, or that of your guests, disturbs the quiet enjoyment of any other resident, you will take all reasonable steps to decrease the amount of smoke generated. These steps may include, but are not limited to, purchasing and using a smokeless ashtray and/or air filtration device, reducing the amount of smoking, ceasing any smoking on decks, patios or other outdoor areas, closing doors and windows. Failure of Resident to take such reasonable steps after a written request from Landlord will be a violation of these Rules &amp; Regulations.\\n8\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

How lead affects health\\nÂ· What you can do to protect your family\\nÂ· Where to go for more information\\nBefore renting or buying a pre-1978 home or apartment, federal law requires:\\nÂ· Sellers must disclose known information on lead-based paint or lead- based paint hazards before selling a house.\\nÂ· Real estate sales contracts must include a specific warning statement about lead-based paint. Buyers have up to 10 days to check for lead.\\nÂ· Landlords must disclose known information on lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards before leases take effect. Leases must include a specific warning statement about lead-based paint.\\nIf undertaking renovations, repairs, or painting (RRP) projects in your pre-1978 home or apartment:\\nÂ· Read EPA&#x27;s pamphlet, The Lead-Safe Certified Guide to Renovate Right, to learn about the lead-safe work practices that contractors are required to follow when working in your home (see page 12).\\nSimple Steps to Protect Your Family from Lead Hazards\\nIf you think your home has lead-based paint:\\n. Don&#x27;t try to remove lead-based paint yourself.\\nÂ· Always keep painted surfaces in good condition to minimize deterioration.\\n. Get your home checked for lead hazards. Find a certified inspector or risk assessor at epa.gov/lead.\\n. Talk to your landlord about fixing surfaces with peeling or chipping paint.\\nÂ· Regularly clean floors, window sills, and other surfaces.\\nÂ· Take precautions to avoid exposure to lead dust when remodeling.\\nÂ· When renovating, repairing, or painting, hire only EPA- or state- approved Lead-Safe certified renovation firms.\\nÂ· Before buying, renting, or renovating your home, have it checked for lead-based paint.\\nÂ· Consult your health care provider about testing your children for lead. Your pediatrician can check for lead with a simple blood test.\\nÂ· Wash children&#x27;s hands, bottles, pacifiers, and toys often.\\nÂ· Make sure children eat healthy, low-fat foods high in iron, calcium, and vitamin C.\\n. Remove shoes or wipe soil off shoes before entering your house.\\nLead Gets into the Body in Many Ways\\nAdults and children can get lead into their bodies if they:\\nÂ· Breathe in lead dust (especially during activities such as renovations, repairs, or painting that disturb painted surfaces).\\n. Swallow lead dust that has settled on food, food preparation surfaces, and other places.\\n. Eat paint chips or soil that contains lead.\\nLead is especially dangerous to children under the age of 6.\\nÂ· At this age, children&#x27;s brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead.\\nÂ· Children&#x27;s growing bodies absorb more lead.\\nÂ· Babies and young children often put their hands and other objects in their mouths. These objects can have lead dust on them.\\nWomen of childbearing age should know that lead is dangerous to a developing fetus.\\nÂ· Women with a high lead level in their system before or during pregnancy risk exposing the fetus to lead through the placenta during fetal development.\\nN 2\\nMarch 2021\\n1\\nBlue Moon eSignature Services Document ID: 380993857 :selected:\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\n13.7 Off-Limit Areas. You must not let an animal-other than an assistance or service animal-into swimming-pool areas, laun- dry rooms, offices, clubrooms, other recreational facilities, or other dwelling units besides your own, except that search and rescue dogs shall be allowed to use areas of the property ac- cessible to the general public, such as the leasing office, Cer- tain service animals in training shall also be allowed to use those areas when accompanied by an approved trainer.\\n13.8 Food &amp; Water. Your animal must be fed and given water in- side the dwelling unit. You may not leave animal food or water outside the dwelling unit at any time, except in fenced yards (if any) for your exclusive use.\\n13.9 Leash. You must keep the animal on a leash and under your su- pervision when outside the dwelling or in any private fenced area. We or our representative may pick up unleashed animals, report them to the proper authorities, or do both. We&#x27;ll charge you a rea- sonable fee for picking up and keeping unleashed animals.\\n13.10Animal Waste. Unless we have designated a particular area in your dwelling unit or on the grounds for animal defecation and urination, you are prohibited from letting an animal defecate or urinate anywhere on our property and you must take the ani- mal off our property for that purpose. If we allow animal defeca- tion inside the unit, you must ensure that it&#x27;s done in a litter box with a kitty-litter-type mix. If the animal defecates anywhere on our property (including in a fenced yard for your exclusive use), you must immediately remove the waste and repair any damage. In addition to the terms of this addendum, you must comply with all local ordinances regarding animal defecation.\\n14. Additional Rules. We may make reasonable changes to the animal rules from time to time if we distribute a written copy of any changes to every resident who is allowed to have animals.\\n15. Violation of Rules. If you, your guest, or any occupant violates any rule or provision of this addendum (in our judgment) and we give you written notice of the violation, you must remove the animal immedi- ately and permanently from the premises. We also have all other rights and remedies set forth in the Lease, including eviction and recovering damages and attorney&#x27;s fees from you.\\n16. Complaints About Animal. If we receive a reasonable complaint from a neighbor or other resident or if we, in our sole discretion, determine that the animal has disturbed neighbors or other residents, we will give you written notice and you must immediately and permanently remove the animal from the premises.\\n17. Our Removal of an Animal. In some circumstances, we may enter the dwelling unit and remove the animal within one day after leaving a written notice in a conspicuous place.\\n17.1 Causes for Removal. We can remove an animal under this para- graph if, in our sole judgment, you have:\\n(A) abandoned the animal;\\n(B) left the animal in the dwelling unit for an extended period of time without food or water;\\n(C) failed to care for a sick animal;\\n(D) violated our animal rules; OR\\n(E) let the animal defecate or urinate where it&#x27;s not allowed.\\n17.2 Removal Process. To remove an animal, we must follow the procedures in the Lease, and we may turn the animal over to a humane society or local authority. We&#x27;ll return the animal to you upon request if we haven&#x27;t already turned it over to a humane society or local authority. We don&#x27;t have a lien on the animal for any purpose, but you must pay for reasonable care and ken- neling charges for the animal. If you don&#x27;t pick up the animal within five days after we remove it, it will be considered aban- doned.\\n18. Liability for Damage, Injuries, Cleaning. Except for reasonable wear and tear resulting from an assistance or service animal, you and all co- residents are jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of any damage the animal causes, including cleaning, defleaing, or deodor- izing. This provision applies to all parts of the dwelling unit including carpets, doors, walls, drapes, wallpaper, windows, screens, furniture, and appliances, as well as landscaping and other outside improvements. If an `item cannot be satisfactorily cleaned or repaired, you must pay for us to replace it. Payment for damage, repairs, cleaning, replacements, and the like are due immediately upon demand. As the owner, you&#x27;re strictly liable for the entire amount of any injury that your animal causes to an- other person or to anyone&#x27;s property. You indemnify us for all costs of litigation and attorney&#x27;s fees resulting from any such injury or damage.\\n19. Move-Out. Except for reasonable wear and tear resulting from an as- sistance or service animal, when you move out, you&#x27;ll pay for deflea- ing, deodorizing, and shampooing to protect future residents from possible health hazards, regardless of how long the animal was there. We-not you-will arrange for these services.\\n20. Multiple Residents. Each resident who signed the Lease must also sign this addendum. You, your guests, and any occupants must follow all animal rules. Each resident is jointly and severally liable for dam- ages and all other obligations set forth in this addendum, even if the resident does not own the animal.\\n21. Dog Park. We may provide an area to be used as a dog park. While using the park, you will be required to supervise your dog, but may remove the leash. Leashes must be used while traveling to and from the park. The park is not supervised or monitored in any way, and you use the park at your own risk. We are not liable for any injury, damage or loss which is caused as a result of any problem, defect or malfunc- tion of the park. We are also not liable for injury, damage or loss to any person, animal or property caused by any other person or animal, including, but not limited to, dog bite, trespass, assault or any other crime. Furthermore, we are not liable for any disruption in the park&#x27;s operation or performance. You hereby release us and our agents, con- tractors, employees and representatives from any liability connected with the park. You agree to be responsible for any property damage caused by you, your guests or other occupants to the park. You un- derstand that participating in any activity at the park carries a risk of injury, and you are willing to assume this risk. We make no representa- tions or warranties of any kind regarding the park.\\n22. General. You acknowledge that no other oral or written agreement exists regarding animals. Except for any special provisions noted in paragraph 11 above, our representative has no authority to modify this addendum or the animal rules except in writing as described under paragraph 14. This Animal Addendum and the animal rules are consid- ered part of the Lease described above.\\n23. Animal Restrictions. No animal will be allowed that poses a threat to any other person. You represent that your animal(s) does not pose a danger or threat of any kind to any person or property; has not dis- played vicious, aggressive or dangerous behavior; and has never be- fore injured you or any other person or animal or caused any dam- age to your property or another person&#x27;s property. You affirmatively represent and warrant that you have never had a claim or lawsuit filed against you or anyone else for an injury or damage caused by or re- lated to the animal. You understand and agree that the approval of the animal to live in your apartment is expressly conditioned upon all of the forgoing being true and if you have made any misrepresentation it is a violation of the Lease.\\nYou are legally bound by this document. Please read it carefully.\\nYou are entitled to receive a copy of this Addendum after it is fully signed.

Your goal is to accurately extract data fields from the provided OCR text of a lease agreement. Additionally, correct any obvious OCR errors you encounter during extraction.\\n\\n### INPUT TEXT:\\nBelow is the OCR text extracted from a lease agreement. Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\n(5) you or any occupant is arrested, convicted, or given deferred adjudication for a felony offense involving actual or potential physical harm to a person, or involving possession, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana, or drug paraphernalia under state statute; or (6) any illegal drugs or paraphernalia are found in your apartment.\\nTermination of Rental Agreement - Your Failure to Pay Rent Due. If you default by failing to pay rent when due and the default continues for three (3) days, not counting Saturday, Sunday, and court-observed legal holidays, after delivery of a written demand for payment of the rent or possession of the premises, we may terminate the rental agreement. Termination of this lease for non- payment of rent, or termination of your possession rights, filing of an action for possession, eviction, issuance of a writ of possession, or subsequent reletting doesn&#x27;t release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations.\\nTermination of Rental Agreement - Your Failure to Comply with F.S. 83.52 or Material Provisions of the Lease.\\n(1) If you default by materially failing to comply with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of this lease, the rules and regulations, or any addenda (other than failure to pay rent due), and the non-compliance is of a nature that YOU SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE or if your non- compliance CONSTITUTES A SECOND OR CONTINUING NON- COMPLIANCE WITHIN TWELVE (12) MONTHS OF A SIMILAR VIOLATION, we may terminate the lease by delivering written notice specifying the nature of the non-compliance and our intention to terminate the lease. Upon receiving such a lease termination notice without opportunity to cure or constituting a second violation within 12 months, you will have seven (7) days from delivery of the notice to vacate the apartment and premises. Examples of non-compliance which are without opportunity to cure include, but are not limited to, destruction, damage, or misuse of our or other resident&#x27;s property by your intentional acts or a subsequent or continued unreasonable disturbance.\\n(2) If you default by materially failing to comply with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of this lease, the rules and regulations, or any addenda (other than failure to pay rent due), and the non-compliance is of a nature that YOU SHOULD be given an opportunity to cure it, we may deliver a written notice to you specifying the nature of the non-compliance and notifying you that unless the non-compliance is corrected within seven (7) days of delivery of the notice, we may terminate the lease. If you fail to correct the violation within seven (7) days of receiving such notice or if you repeat same conduct or conduct of a similar nature within a twelve (12) month period, we may terminate your lease without giving you any further opportunity to cure the non-compliance as provided above. Examples of non-compliance in which we will give you an opportunity to cure the violation include, but are not limited to, unauthorized pets, guests, or vehicles, parking in an unauthorized manner, or failing to keep the apartment and premises clean and sanitary. We will also have all rights under Florida law and this lease to tow or remove improperly parked vehicles in addition to our remedy of terminating the lease for such violations.\\nTermination of this lease for non-compliance with F.S. 83.52 or material provisions of the lease, termination of your possession rights, filing of an action for possession, eviction, issuance of a writ of possession, or subsequent reletting doesn&#x27;t release you from liability for future rent or other lease obligations.\\nHoldover. You or any occupant, invitee, or guest must not hold over beyond the date contained in your move-out notice or our notice to vacate (or beyond a different move-out date agreed to by the parties in writing). If a holdover occurs, then: (1) holdover rent\\nis due in advance on a daily basis and may become delinquent without notice or demand; (2) we may file a holdover eviction lawsuit pursuant to Fla, Stat. Â§83.58 to recover possession of the dwelling unit, double the amount of rent due for each day that you continue to holdover and refuse to surrender possession during the holdover period, breach of contract damages, attorney fees and court costs as may be applicable; or (3) at our option, we may extend the Lease Contract term-for up to one month from the date of notice of Lease Contract extension-by delivering written notice to you or your apartment while you continue to hold over.\\nOther Remedies. We may report unpaid amounts to credit agencies. If we, or a third-party debt collector we use, try to collect any money you owe us, you agree that we or the debt collector may call you on your cell phone and may use an automated dialer. If you default and move out early, you will pay us any amounts stated to be rental discounts in paragraph 10 (Special Provisions), in addition to other sums due. Upon your default, we have all other legal remedies under state statute. Unless a party is seeking exemplary, punitive, sentimental or personal-injury damages, the prevailing party may recover from the non-prevailing party attorney&#x27;s fees and all other litigation costs. Attorney fees and all other expenses shall be deemed &quot;costs&quot;. Late charges are liquidated damages for our time, inconvenience, and overhead in collecting late rent (but are not for attorney&#x27;s fees and litigation costs). All unpaid amounts bear 18% interest per year from due date, compounded annually. You must pay all collection-agency fees if you fail to pay all sums due within 10 days after we mail you a letter demanding payment and stating that collection agency fees will be added if you don&#x27;t pay all sums by that deadline. Unless modified by Addendum, you will also be liable for all of our actual damages related to your breach of the Lease Contract.\\nChoice of Remedies and Mitigation of Damages. If you move out early, you&#x27;ll be subject to paragraph 11 (Early Move-Out) and all other remedies. If we regain possession of the apartment as a result of your breach of the lease, or because you surrendered possession of the apartment, or because you abandoned possession of the apartment, or because we obtained possession through eviction proceedings, unless modified by Addendum, we may either (a) treat the lease as terminated and re-take possession FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT; (b) re-take possession of the apartment FOR YOUR ACCOUNT and attempt in good faith to re-let it on your behalf; or (c) take no action to obtain possession or re-let the apartment and continue to collect rent from you as it comes due. If we take possession of the apartment for our own account, then you will have no further liability for rents under the remainder of the lease. If we take possession of the apartment for your account and attempt to re-let it, you will remain liable for the difference between the rental remaining due under the lease and the amount we are able to recover by making a good faith effort at re-letting the premises on your behalf. We are not required to make an election of which remedies we choose to pursue nor notify you of which remedies we will select.\\nLease Renewal When A Breach or Default Has Occurred. In the event that you enter into a subsequent Lease prior to the expiration of this Lease and you breach or otherwise commit a default under this Lease, We may, at our sole and absolute discretion, terminate the subsequent Lease, even if the subsequent Lease term has yet to commence. We may terminate said subsequent Lease by sending you written notice of our desire to terminate said subsequent Lease.\\nRemedies Cumulative. Except where limited or prohibited by law, any remedies set forth herein shall be cumulative, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies available to Landlord under any applicable law.\\nGeneral Clauses\\n34. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. You understand and acknowledge that neither we nor any of our representatives have authority to make any statements, promises or representations in conflict with or in addition to the information contained in this Lease Contract or by a separate written agreement signed by you and us, and we hereby specifically disclaim any responsibility for any such statements, promises or representations.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\n4. PAYMENTS\\n4.1 RENT\\nYou must pay us the Rent amount specified in the Variable Lease Term section. Certain additional amounts due to us are also specified in this Agreement. We reserve our right under Civil Code Â§1479 to apply any payments we receive to any amounts due (whether Rent, Late Charges or any other amount) in any manner we choose, and any contrary instructions or conditions you may attempt to impose will be of no force or effect. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all amounts are payable in advance, on the first day of each calendar month, without demand, setoff or deduction. The daily value of the Residence will be calculated based on a 30-day month.\\n4.2 PAYMENT DETAIL\\nPayment instructions (including forms of payment accepted, to whom payments are to be made, and the address where payments are to be made), are specified in the Variable Lease Term section. Any payments made by mail or placed in a drop box are made at your risk and must be received by us by the due date. You will incur a $25.00 charge for the first dishonored check and $35.00 for any subsequent dishonored check. After receiving any dishonored payment (whether under this Agreement or any other), we reserve the right to require all further payments made by you or on your behalf to be made by money order, certified check or cashier&#x27;s check. If a third party tenders a payment on your behalf, we reserve the right to require an acknowledgment from the third party as specified in Civil Code Â§1947.3(a)(3).\\nWe may, but are not required, to accept payments electronically or by credit card, either directly or through a third party payment service system. If you are interested in these payment methods, request information about our current electronic and credit card payment acceptance policy from the management office. We reserve the right at any time to change our electronic and credit card payment policies and/ or procedures, the third party payment service system and/ or to cease accepting electronic or credit card payments. It is your responsibility before any payment is due to verify whether we are currently accepting payments electronically or by credit card, the proper procedure, and to arrange with us or any third party payment service system to pay electronically or by credit card. A third party payment service system may charge a fee for this service to you and will have specific requirements and procedures you must follow. If any electronic or credit card payment to us or the third party payment service system, or if any payment tendered on your behalf by a third party, is reversed, not honored, or results in a &quot;charge back,&quot; you will be responsible for Late Charges and any additional cost to us or the payment service system, and we will retain all rights and remedies, including the right to terminate your tenancy.\\nIf you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from the check to make a one- time electronic fund transfer from the account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from the check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from the account as soon as the same day we receive the payment, and you will not receive the check back from your financial institution.\\nUse of drop boxes is at your risk. You can reduce the risk of theft of your payment by using electronic payment methods (if we accept electronic payments), or by mailing or personally delivering payments as directed. All checks and money orders must be made payable as specified on the first page of this Agreement. Do not leave the name of the payee blank on checks or money orders; you will not receive a payment credit if the check or money order is stolen and cashed by another party.\\n4.3 SECURITY DEPOSIT\\nWe will hold the Security Deposit in compliance with California Civil Code Â§1950.5.

Carefully analyze this text, and extract the relevant data fields.\\n\\nOCR Text:\\n```\\nYou must immediately report carbon monoxide detector malfunctions to us in writing. Neither you nor others may disable carbon monoxide detectors. If you damage or disable the carbon monoxide detector or remove a battery without replacing it with a working battery, you may be liable to us for actual damages and attorney&#x27;s fees. If you disable or damage the carbon monoxide detector, or fail to replace a dead battery or report malfunctions to us, you may be liable to us and others for any loss, damage, or fines and you may be in violation of Illinois law and local ordinance.\\nCasualty Loss. We&#x27;re not liable to any resident, guest, or occupant for personal injury or damage or loss of personal property from any cause, including but not limited to: fire, smoke, rain, flood, water and pipe leaks, hail, ice, snow, lightning, wind, explosions, interruption of utilities, theft, or vandalism unless otherwise required by law. We have no duty to remove any ice, sleet, or snow but may remove any amount with or without notice. During freezing weather, you must ensure that the temperature in the apartment is sufficient to make sure that the pipes do not freeze (the appropriate temperature will depend upon weather conditions and the size and layout of your unit). If the pipes freeze or any other damage is caused by your failure to properly maintain the heat in your apartment, you&#x27;ll be liable for damage to our and other&#x27;s property. If you ask our representatives to perform services not contemplated in this Lease Contract, you will indemnify us and hold us harmless from all liability for these services to the extent allowed by applicable law.\\nCrime or Emergency. Dial 911 or immediately call local medical emergency, fire, or police personnel in case of accident, fire, smoke, suspected criminal activity, or other emergency involving imminent harm. You should then contact our representative. Unless otherwise provided by law, we&#x27;re not liable to you or any guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, or other crimes. We&#x27;re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We&#x27;re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law-enforcement agency. You also must notify us and furnish us with the law-enforcement agency&#x27;s incident report number upon request.\\n25. CONDITION OF THE PREMISES AND ALTERATIONS. You accept the apartment, fixtures, and furniture as is, except for conditions materially affecting the health or safety of ordinary persons. You will be given an Inventory and Condition form on or before move- in. You must sign and note on the form all defects or damage and return it to our representative. Otherwise, everything will be considered to be in a clean, safe, and good working condition.\\nYou must use customary diligence in maintaining the apartment and not damaging or littering the common areas. Unless authorized by statute (or Ordinance), or by us in writing, you must not make any alterations to the premises, nor perform any repairs, painting, wallpapering, carpeting, or electrical changes, nor install any appliances, locks or other equipment of any kind, or otherwise alter our property. No holes or stickers are allowed inside or outside the apartment. We will permit a reasonable number of small nail holes for hanging pictures on sheetrock walls and in grooves of wood- paneled walls, unless our rules state otherwise. No water furniture, washing machines, additional phone or TV-cable outlets, alarm systems, or lock changes, additions, or rekeying is permitted unless statutorily allowed or we&#x27;ve consented in writing. You may install a satellite dish or antenna provided you sign our satellite dish or antenna lease addendum which complies with reasonable restrictions allowed by federal law. You agree not to alter, damage, or remove our property, including alarm systems, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, radon detectors, furniture, telephone and cable TV wiring, screens, locks, and access control devices. When you move in, we&#x27;ll supply light bulbs for fixtures we furnish, including exterior fixtures operated from inside the apartment; after that, you&#x27;ll replace them at your expense with bulbs of the same type and wattage. Your improvements to the apartment (whether or not we consent) become ours unless we agree otherwise in writing.\\n26.REQUESTS, REPAIRS, AND MALFUNCTIONS. IF YOU OR ANY OCCUPANT NEEDS TO SEND A NOTICE OR REQUEST-FOR EXAMPLE, FOR REPAIRS, INSTALLATIONS, SERVICES, OR SECURITY-RELATED MATTERS-IT MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH EITHER THE ONLINE TENANT/MAINTENANCE PORTAL, OR SIGNED AND IN WRITING AND DELIVERED TO OUR DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE (except in case of fire, smoke, gas, explosion, overflowing sewage, uncontrollable running water, electrical shorts, or crime in progress as described in Paragraph 24 - Resident Safety and Property Loss). Our written notes on your oral request do not constitute a written request from you.\\nOur complying with or responding to any oral request regarding security or non-security matters doesn&#x27;t waive the strict requirement for written notices under this Lease Contract. You must promptly notify us in writing of: water leaks; electrical problems; malfunctioning lights; broken or missing locks or latches; and other conditions that pose a hazard to property, health, or safety. We may change or install utility lines or equipment serving the apartment if the work is done reasonably without substantially increasing your utility costs. We may turn off equipment and interrupt utilities as needed to avoid property damage or to perform work. If utilities malfunction or are damaged by fire, water, or similar cause, you must notify our representative immediately. Air conditioning problems are not emergencies. If air conditioning or other equipment malfunctions, you must notify our representative as soon as possible on a business day. We&#x27;ll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections, taking into consideration when casualty insurance proceeds are received. Rent will not abate in whole or in part unless authorized under Illinois law (or local Ordinance).\\nIf we believe that fire or catastrophic damage is substantial, or that performance of needed repairs poses a danger to you, we may terminate your tenancy within a reasonable time by giving you written notice. If your tenancy is so terminated, we&#x27;ll refund prorated rent and all deposits, less lawful deductions.\\n27. ANIMALS. Unless otherwise provided under federal, state, or local law, no animals (including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, rodents, and insects) are allowed, even temporarily, anywhere in the apartment or apartment community unless we&#x27;ve so authorized in writing. You must remove an illegal or unauthorized animal within 24 hours of notice from us, or you will be considered in default of this Lease Contract. If we allow an animal as a pet, you must execute a separate animal addendum which may require additional deposits, rents, fees or other charges. An animal deposit is considered a general security deposit. We will authorize an assistance animal for a disabled person. When allowed by applicable laws, before we authorize an assistance animal, if the disability is not readily apparent, we may require a written statement from a qualified professional verifying the disability-related need for the assistance animal. If we authorize an assistance animal, we may require you to execute a separate animal and/or assistance animal addendum. Animal deposits, additional rents, fees or other charges will not be required for an assistance animal needed due to disability, including an emotional support or service animal, as authorized under federal, state, or local law. You must not feed stray or wild animals.\\nIf you or any guest or occupant violates animal restrictions (with or without your knowledge), you&#x27;ll be subject to charges, damages, eviction, and other remedies provided in this Lease Contract. If an animal has been in the apartment at any time during your term of occupancy (with or without our consent), we&#x27;ll charge you for defleaing, deodorizing, and shampooing, if we deem it necessary, and we may withhold these amounts from your security deposit as describe in Paragraph 48 (Security Deposit Interest, Deductions and Other Charges).\\n28. WHEN WE MAY ENTER. Except as prohibited by state law or local ordinance, if you or any guest or occupant is present, then repairers, servicers, contractors, our representatives or other persons listed in (2) below may peacefully enter the apartment at reasonable times for the purposes listed in (2) below.

Resident shall pay to Landlord upon Move-In a one-time utility transfer verification fee of $0.00. Landlord shall have the exclusive right to change or install utility lines, cable service components and/or systems, meters, sub-metering or load management systems, and similar electrical equipment serving the Premises. Landlord shall have the right, upon thirty (30) days&#x27; notice to Resident, to increase the monthly payment due by Resident in an amount reasonably related to any increase in the cost of water, electricity and/ or natural gas, or any other utility that the Landlord has agreed to pay. Landlord may, and Landlord&#x27;s choice, allocate those utility charges between the various apartments using any lawful formula, including but not limited to formulas based on sub-metering, comparative square footage, number of bedrooms, number of occupants, or number of bathrooms. Under any allocation formula, Resident may be paying for part of the utility usage in common areas or in other residential units. Additionally, Landlord or third-party billing service may charge a reasonable monthly fee for the cost of administering and billing any shared utility charges.\\n1.9 LATE, RETURNED CHECK, EVICTION AND OTHER FEES AND CHARGES\\nRent is late if it is not paid by 11:59pm on the day it is due. If Landlord has not received the monthly rent and any other sums due from Resident for any given month on or before the eighth (8th) day of the month, Resident shall pay a late charge of $50.00. Dishonored checks are any checks that are dishonored or not paid upon presentment of a single time for any reason, or any electronic payments not paid or credited for any reason. Resident agrees to pay Landlord $20 (Twenty) for each dishonored check in addition to any applicable late fees and actual damages incurred by Landlord. Except for non-payment of rent, Resident is subject to a legal notice posting fee of $75 per occurrence. Upon Demand, Resident must immediately replace any dishonored check with certified funds. If Resident makes any payment in response to an eviction notice or demand for rent or possession, Resident shall make such payments in certified funds and not by any electronic payment method. Resident agrees to pay all legal costs and Sheriff&#x27;s fees resulting from Resident&#x27;s eviction from the premises. Resident may not withhold or offset rent for any reason whatsoever unless in accordance with law.\\n1.10 STATUTORY RIGHT TO CURE\\nPursuant to Colorado law, Resident has the right to pay all amounts due prior to a court entering a judgment for possession if Resident is being evicted for non-payment of rent. If Resident exercises Resident&#x27;s statutory right to pay, Landlord only has to accept Resident&#x27;s payment if Resident fully pays all amounts due according to eviction notice, as well as any rent that remains due under this Agreement. If Resident exercises Resident&#x27;s right to pay, Resident agrees to pay in certified funds in the management office during business hours. If Resident exercises Resident&#x27;s statutory right to pay in response to an eviction notice after the notice has expired and after Landlord&#x27;s attorney has filed an eviction case with a court to enforce Landlord&#x27;s legal rights but before the court has entered a judgment for possession, Resident agrees to pay Landlord&#x27;s current attorney&#x27;s fees and court costs as set forth in the eviction notice in addition to any other amounts due pursuant to the Lease and all other amounts set forth in the notice. If Landlord files an eviction case and the court determines the possession issue because Resident disputes the eviction case, attorneys&#x27; fees and costs will be awarded to the prevailing party as determined by the court consistent with the parties&#x27; intent to have attorneys&#x27; fees and court costs awarded to the prevailing party in disputed court actions as set forth in paragraph 33 of this Agreement.\\n1.11 NOTICE TO VACATE\\nResident shall give Landlord at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of Resident&#x27;s intent to vacate the Premises. Resident&#x27;s notice to vacate shall specify the date that Resident will vacate (&quot;Vacate Date&quot;) and such date shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date Resident gives notice and shall not be for a date prior to the end of the Lease Term. Landlord is not obligated to give 30 days&#x27; notice. Landlord must give the appropriate notice provided for in the Colorado Revised Statutes, which in some cases is as little as 3 days&#x27; notice. If Resident gives any notice to vacate, the 30-day period commences on the day after Resident gives notice, and Resident shall vacate on or before the last day of the notice period. Regardless of when Resident gives notice, Resident agrees to pay Landlord rent for the entire notice period regardless of whether Resident occupies the Premises for the entire notice period. Resident&#x27;s notice to Landlord shall be effective if executed by any Resident who executed the Lease, regardless of whether any or all other Residents who executed this Lease sign the notice. Resident&#x27;s notice of intent to vacate shall only be effective on the date after the notice is actually received by and receipted for by Landlord. Resident agrees to personally deliver any notice to vacate to Landlord to guarantee the effective date of any notice. If Resident vacates without giving notice as required in this paragraph, Resident shall be liable for and agrees to pay Landlord for 30 days of rent previously or actually paid by Resident covering the 30-days of rent less any amounts of rent previously or actually paid by Resident covering the 30-day notice period. Regardless of the number of days in a month, Resident agrees that notices tendered AFTER the first day of any month shall not be effective to terminate this Lease Contract until the last day of the following month (example: notice received on June 3 will not terminate lease until July 31.). If Resident fails to give the required notice to vacate, Resident agrees that the amounts agreed to be paid by Resident in such event represent a fair amount to allocate the numerous risks and liabilities between Resident and Landlord. Resident shall pay all amounts set forth in this paragraph, in addition to any other amounts owed by Resident under the terms of this Agreement. However, if Resident is liable for a re-letting fee due to a lease break in accordance with paragraph 1.12, Resident shall not\\n3\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.

You and all guests and occupants must comply with any written apartment rules and community policies, including instructions for care of our property. Our rules are considered part of this Lease Contract. We may make reasonable changes to written rules, effective immediately, if they are distributed and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not change dollar amounts on page 1 of this Lease Contract.\\n20.LIMITATIONS ON CONDUCT. The apartment and other areas reserved for your private use must be kept clean. Trash must be disposed of at least weekly in appropriate receptacles in accordance with local ordinances. Passageways may be used only for entry or exit. Any swimming pools, saunas, spas, tanning beds, exercise rooms, storerooms, laundry rooms, and similar areas must be used with care in accordance with apartment rules and posted signs. Glass containers are prohibited in or near pools and all common areas. You, your occupants, or guests may not anywhere in the apartment community: use candles or use kerosene lamps without our prior written approval; cook on balconies or outside; or solicit business or contributions. Conducting any kind of business (including child care services) in your apartment or in the apartment community is prohibited-except that any lawful business conducted &quot;at home&quot; by computer, mail, or telephone is permissible if customers, clients, patients, or other business associates do not come to your apartment for business purposes. We may regulate: (1) the use of patios, balconies, and porches; (2) the conduct of furniture movers and delivery persons; and (3) recreational activities in common areas.\\nWe may exclude from the apartment community, to the extent permitted by statutes, guests or others who, in our judgment, have been violating the law, violating this Lease Contract or any apartment rules, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, or owner representatives. We may also exclude from any outside area or common area, to the extent permitted by statutes, a person who refuses to show photo identification or refuses to identify himself or herself as a resident, occupant, or guest of a specific resident in the community.\\nYou agree to notify us if you or any occupants are convicted of any felony, or misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to another person or destruction of property. You also agree to notify us if you or any occupant registers as a sex offender in any state. Informing us of criminal convictions or sex offender registry does not waive our right to evict you.\\n21.PROHIBITED CONDUCT. You and your occupants or guests may not engage in the following activities: behaving in a loud or obnoxious manner; disturbing or threatening the rights, comfort, health, safety, or convenience of others (including our agents and employees) in or near the apartment community; disrupting our business operations; manufacturing, delivering, possessing with intent to deliver, or otherwise possessing a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia; engaging in or threatening violence; possessing a weapon prohibited by state law; discharging a firearm in the apartment community; displaying or possessing a gun, knife, or other weapon in the common area in a way that may alarm others; storing anything in closets having gas appliances; tampering with utilities or telecommunications; bringing hazardous materials into the apartment community; or injuring our reputation by making bad faith allegations against us to others.\\n22.PARKING. We may regulate the time, manner, and place of parking all cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, boats, trailers, and recreational vehicles. Motorcycles or motorized bikes may not be parked inside an apartment unit or on sidewalks, under stairwells, or in handicapped parking areas. We may have unauthorized or illegally parked vehicles towed by following applicable state law procedures. A vehicle is unauthorized or illegally parked in the apartment community if it:\\n(1) has a flat tire or other condition rendering it inoperable; or\\n(2) is on jacks, blocks or has wheel(s) missing; or\\n(3) has no current license or no current inspection sticker; or\\n(4) takes up more than one parking space; or\\n(5) belongs to a resident or occupant who has surrendered or abandoned the apartment; or\\n(6) is parked in a marked handicap space without the legally required handicap insignia; or\\n(7) is parked in space marked for manager, staff, or guest at the office; or\\n(8) blocks another vehicle from exiting; or\\n(9) is parked in a fire lane or designated &quot;no parking&quot; area; or\\n(10) is parked in a space marked for other resident(s) or unit(s); or\\n(11) is parked on the grass, sidewalk, or patio; or\\n(12) blocks garbage trucks from access to a dumpster; or\\n(13) belongs to a resident and is parked in a visitor or retail parking space.\\n23.RELEASE OF RESIDENT. Unless you&#x27;re entitled to terminate your tenancy under paragraphs 11 (Special Provisions), 17 (Delay of Occupancy), 24 (Military Personnel Clause), 32 (Responsibilities of Owner), or 37 (Move-Out Notice), or under Oklahoma law, you won&#x27;t be released from this Lease Contract for any reason-including but not limited to voluntary or involuntary school withdrawal or transfer, voluntary or involuntary job transfer, marriage, separation, divorce, reconciliation, loss of co-residents, loss of employment, bad health, or death.\\n24.MILITARY PERSONNEL CLAUSE. All parties to this Lease Contract agree to comply with any federal law, including, but not limited to the Service Member&#x27;s Civil Relief Act, or any applicable state law(s), if you are seeking to terminate this Lease Contract and/or subsequent renewals and/or Lease Contract extensions under the rights granted by such laws.\\n25.RESIDENT SAFETY AND PROPERTY LOSS. You and all occupants and guests must exercise due care for your own and others&#x27; safety and security, especially in the use of smoke detectors, keyed deadbolt locks, keyless bolting devices, window latches, and other access control devices.\\nSmoke Detectors. We&#x27;ll furnish smoke detectors as required by statute, and we&#x27;ll test them and provide working batteries when you first take possession. After that, you must pay for and replace batteries as needed, unless the law provides otherwise. You must test automatic fire alarms at the beginning of your lease term and monthly thereafter. We may replace dead or missing batteries at your expense, without prior notice to you. Neither you nor others may disable smoke detectors. If you damage or disable the smoke detector or remove a battery without replacing it with a working battery, you may be liable to us for $100 plus one month&#x27;s rent, actual damages, and attorney&#x27;s fees. If you disable or damage the smoke detector, or fail to replace a dead battery or report malfunctions to us, you will be liable to us and others for any loss, damage, or fines from fire, smoke, or water.\\nCasualty Loss. We&#x27;re not liable to any resident, guest, or occupant for personal injury or damage or loss of personal property from any cause, including but not limited to: fire, smoke, rain, flood, water and pipe leaks, hail, ice, snow, lightning, wind, explosions, interruption of utilities, theft, or vandalism unless otherwise required by law. We have no duty to remove any ice, sleet, or snow but may remove any amount with or without notice. During freezing weather, you must ensure that the temperature in the apartment is sufficient to make sure that the pipes do not freeze (we suggest at least 50 degrees). If the pipes freeze or any other damage is caused by your failure to properly maintain the heat in your apartment, you&#x27;ll be liable for damage to our and other&#x27;s property. If you ask our representatives to perform services not contemplated in this Lease Contract, you will indemnify us and hold us harmless from all liability for these services.\\nCrime or Emergency. Dial 911 or immediately call local medical emergency, fire, or police personnel in case of accident, fire, smoke, or suspected criminal activity, or other emergency involving imminent harm. You should then contact our representative. Unless otherwise provided by law, we&#x27;re not liable to you or any guests or occupants for injury, damage, or loss to person or property caused by criminal conduct of other persons, including theft, burglary, assault, vandalism, or other crimes. We&#x27;re not obliged to furnish security personnel, security lighting, security gates or fences, or other forms of security. If we provide any access control devices or security measures upon the property, they are not a guarantee to prevent crime or to reduce the risk of crime on the property. You agree that no access control or security measures can eliminate all crime and that you will not rely upon any provided access control or security measures as a warranty or guarantee of any kind. We&#x27;re not responsible for obtaining criminal-history checks on any residents, occupants, guests, or contractors in the apartment community or in the surrounding neighborhood. If you or any occupant or guest is affected by a crime, you must make a written report to our representative and to the appropriate local law- enforcement agency. You also must furnish us with the law- enforcement agency&#x27;s incident report number upon request.\\n@ 2023, National Apartment Association, Inc. - 2/2023, Oklahoma\\nPage 3 of 7\\n```\\n\\n### RESPONSE FORMAT:\\nReturn the extracted data as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following JSON schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ExtractedLeaseData&quot;,\\n  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;,\\n  &quot;properties&quot;: {\\n    &quot;tenant_name&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The name of the tenant, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_address&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit address found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_number&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit number found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;unit_type&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The unit type found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;agreement_date&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_start&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease starts, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_end&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot;,\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The date when the lease ends, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_auto_renew&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;string&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The type of lease auto renewal, found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;hourly_rate&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The hourly rate found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;prorated_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The prorated rent found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;security_deposit&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;lease_rent&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;number&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The security deposit found in the OCR text.&quot;\\n    },\\n    &quot;monthly_payment_breakdown&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The monthly payment breakdown data found in the OCR text.&quot;,\\n      &quot;additionalProperties&quot;: {}\\n    },\\n    &quot;utility_charges&quot;: {\\n      &quot;type&quot;: [\\n        &quot;object&quot;,\\n        &quot;null&quot;\\n      ],\\n      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The utility charges found in the OCR text.
